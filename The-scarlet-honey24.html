         Meanwhile, across Nairobi in Muthaiga, the Maverick residence stood like a fortress of influence.
The marble pillars gleamed, the flag flew high, and armed guards watched from the gates. Inside, Harriet Maverick sat before a long dining table, surrounded by her family — the people who had shaped her into both weapon and mask.
Her father, Senator Henry Maverick, presided over the table like a judge.
“Your name’s back in the news,” he said. “Not for politics — for scandal. The Skeem issue. Care to explain?”
Harriet sipped her wine calmly. “Handled. I made sure the right person took the fall.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Her mother, elegant and sharp as her daughter, frowned. “Handled isn’t enough. You embarrassed the family. The Skeems are our strategic allies — real estate, banking, and half the investment board. You will fix this relationship.”
Her father leaned forward. “Regina Skeem respects power. Not emotion. Make her remember you’re one of us.”
“And the sons?” her mother added with a knowing smile. “Leverage, my dear. Never love. Remember that.”
Harriet’s jaw tightened. “I understand.”
But deep inside, she wasn’t so sure anymore. She’d spent months trying to bury her humiliation, but now the Mbonas — especially Ida — had become her living reminder of everything she’d lost.
She stood after dinner, her heels clicking like echoes of intent. “Then I’ll make them remember me.”
The next week, the Skeem boardroom glittered with reporters, investors, and partners. The success of the Skeem Experience had drawn everyone’s attention — including Harriet Maverick, who swept in wearing confidence like armor.
“Harriet,” Regina greeted coolly. “I wasn’t expecting you.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Business calls for old friends,” Harriet replied, extending a file. “A partnership proposal — Maverick Developments and Skeem Holdings. Urban expansion.”
Raim’s expression was unreadable. Damon’s was skeptical.
But Amel Skeem’s eyes flickered with interest. “This could be useful.”
As they discussed logistics, Harriet’s gaze drifted — past Regina, past the charts, landing squarely on Ida, who stood quietly beside the projection screen, recording minutes.
For a brief second, their eyes met — predator and survivor.
Harriet smiled faintly. “Miss Mbona,” she said sweetly. “Still with us, I see.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Ida replied evenly. “Still standing.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The room’s air shifted — polite smiles, careful silence.
Raim intervened quickly, moving the discussion forward. But the moment had been marked. Harriet was back.
Later that night, as the Skeem brothers left the meeting, Damon spoke first.
“She’s dangerous, Raim. You know that.”
“I know,” Raim said. “But our parents won’t see it until she strikes again.”
Damon looked at him quietly. “And what about Ida? You really think she’s safe in the middle of all this?”
Raim didn’t answer. He didn’t have to.
From the glass tower above, Harriet watched them both, her reflection flickering against the night.
Behind her, her father’s words replayed in her mind: “Use them, don’t love them.”
But as her eyes lingered on the Skeem brothers — and then, almost unwillingly, on Ida — Harriet couldn’t tell anymore what she wanted more: power… or vengeance.
Across the city, in the quiet apartment in Westlands, the Mbona family sat around their new dining table. Nalani poured chai into glass cups, smiling as she looked at her children.
“Do you hear that?” she said softly.
Ephy frowned. “Hear what, Mama?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Nothing,” Nalani said. “Silence. That’s the sound of peace.”
Ida smiled, resting her chin on her hand. “We’ll get used to it.”
Ethan leaned back, grinning. “Maybe. But don’t forget us when you become the boss of Skeem Mall.”
Ida laughed, shaking her head. “Never.”
For that moment, they were just a family again — no scandals, no secrets, just gratitude.
But as she looked out the window at the distant city lights, Ida couldn’t shake a feeling deep in her chest — the sense that peace, like light, never lasts forever in a city built on shadows.
