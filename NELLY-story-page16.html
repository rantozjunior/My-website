    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 16</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 7: Blood And Burden </br> (continued) </h2>
    <p1>Beldarmore grabbed her hand, rolling them out of the creature’s path. Milo fired a small crossbow, pinning one against a wall. Silas and Sophie covered the rear, but one creature lunged at Sophie. Its teeth sank into her arm with a sickening crunch.
“NO!” Silas shouted, rushing forward.
Damon was faster. With a vicious swing, he severed the creature’s head. Its body collapsed at his feet.
Sophie fell to her knees, clutching her arm. “It… it hurts…”
Xekara knelt beside her immediately. “The bite is infectious. If untreated, it will spread quickly.”
Heida’s hand flew to Beldarmore’s arm. “We have to get her out of here!”
Beldarmore gritted his teeth. “We carry her. Now!”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The Long Way Back
The weapons were heavy, and the path back was treacherous. Every step was a battle, every shadow a threat.
Damon hoisted Sophie onto his back, grunting. “Well, I always wanted to play hero. Didn’t think it’d be with a girl dying in my arms. Just my luck.”
Heida ran alongside, checking their flanks. “Keep moving! Don’t let them catch up!”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Beldarmore led, flanking Xekara. She kept close, her shoulder brushing against his occasionally. He felt the warmth, the pull, but kept it aside. Heida’s eyes were sharp, glances quick, worry hidden beneath growing affection.
Sophie’s condition worsened. Her skin was pale, veins darkening. “I… I can’t… keep going…”
“You can,” Beldarmore said firmly, grabbing her hand gently when Damon shifted her slightly. “We’re almost there. Don’t give up.”
Damon muttered under his breath, sarcasm masking worry. “Yeah, just keep shuffling forward while I play nurse, hero, and sarcastic commentator. My life is complete.”
Beldarmore gave him a flat look. “Focus.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Return to Hillsville
Finally, the misty outlines of Hillsville appeared through the trees. The forest smelled like home, yet everything was tinged with fear. Chiesniey rushed to meet them, kneeling beside Sophie.
“She’s infected,” Chiesniey said, examining the bite. “We need a cure immediately.”
Beldarmore sank to his knees beside Sophie. “This is my fault,” he whispered. “I chose her for the mission…”
Heida crouched close, placing a hand on his shoulder. “It’s not your fault. You did what was right for all of us.”
Xekara’s shoulder brushed his lightly. Her eyes were softer than he’d ever seen them. “We will find a way. You carry more than just strength, Beldarmore Valgra. Responsibility, guilt, courage… it is rare among humans.”
He exhaled, chest tight. The weapons lay scattered, heavy but essential. The forest whispered around them, Hillsville holding its breath. The burden of survival—and the weight of hearts drawn to him—pressed down, but he would endure.
Because now, more than ever, he was their anchor.
