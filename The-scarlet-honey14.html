         She smiled nervously. “That’s kind of you, but I should probably—”
“Please,” Raim interrupted gently. “Not as your boss. As a friend.”
Something in his tone disarmed her. He wasn’t the cold, distant executive she’d met on her first day. There was warmth in his eyes now — and something else. Something careful, unspoken.
“Alright,” she said after a pause. “One meal.”
He smiled. “There’s a quiet restaurant near the Arboretum. Eight o’clock?”
“I’ll be there,” she said, surprising even herself.
As she left his office, she caught her reflection in the glass — unsure if the person looking back was the same girl who’d arrived just two days ago from Kawangware.
.<br>.<br>.

That evening, as the sun dipped behind the skyline, Harriet Maverick stood outside The Skeem Mall, her red nails tapping her phone impatiently.
“So it’s true?” she asked the voice on the line.
“Yes, madam,” the man replied. “Her proposal was accepted. The board’s considering a full transformation of the mall — 24-hour operations.”
Harriet’s lips curved into a thin smile.
“All from one little assistant?” she said softly. “How… adorable.”
“And there’s more,” the voice added. “Raim Skeem invited her for dinner.”
Her eyes narrowed. “Dinner?”
A pause. Then her tone darkened.
“Keep watching her. And find out what he sees in her — because I promise you, I’ll see to it that she never sits in that room again.”
She hung up and looked toward the glowing mall sign: SKEEM MALL — WHERE NAIROBI MEETS THE NIGHT.
“Not for long,” she whispered.

Raim chose a quiet corner table near the balcony. The restaurant was elegant but intimate — soft lighting, the sound of slow jazz, and the scent of vanilla candles.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Ida arrived in a simple navy dress, her hair neatly tied. She looked both nervous and radiant.
“You look lovely,” Raim said as she sat down.
“Thank you,” she murmured. “I didn’t expect this.”
“You’ve earned it. That proposal… it’s going to change everything.”
They talked for hours — about ideas, dreams, life beyond wealth and power. She spoke about Kawangware, her mother, her small stall, the nights she studied by candlelight. He listened, genuinely moved.
At one point, he said softly,
“You remind me of what this company used to stand for — before the politics, before the noise.”
She smiled. “Then maybe it’s not too late to bring it back.”
For a moment, silence hung between them — the kind that spoke louder than words. He looked at her, really looked at her, and she felt something shift deep inside her chest.
Then his phone buzzed. A message from Damon:
‘Mother wants an emergency meeting tomorrow morning. It’s about the proposal.’
Raim sighed. “Duty never sleeps.”
“Neither does your mall anymore,” Ida teased softly.
He laughed. “Touché.”

.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The next morning, the Skeem board gathered again. Cameras flashed, reporters waited outside. Amel stood before the microphones, proud and tall.
“After careful consideration,” he said, “the board has decided to implement the ‘Skeem Experience’ — a full transformation of Skeem Mall into Kenya’s first 24-hour lifestyle destination.”
Applause filled the hall. Ida stood quietly at the back, watching, her heart swelling. Her name wasn’t mentioned, but she didn’t mind — she knew what she had started.
Raim caught her eye across the room and gave a small, secret smile.
But in the far corner, Harriet Maverick watched too — her lips curved, but her eyes burned cold.
The game has just begun.
