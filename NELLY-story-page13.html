    <p1>Xekara’s Decision
When evening approached, Xekara approached Beldarmore again. Her steps were quiet; her eyes carried a weight she didn’t show to others.
“I want to return to the city ruins,” she said. “There is something I must confirm. But I will not go alone.”
Her eyes held his. “Come with me.”
Chiesniey stiffened nearby. Heida’s breath caught. Damon raised his eyebrows, smirking knowingly.
Beldarmore nodded slowly. “If there’s danger, we face it together.”
Xekara exhaled softly—a sound almost like relief, though she tried to hide it.
“Prepare,” she whispered. “We leave at twilight.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The Journey Back to the City
The ruins stood like broken teeth against the sky, black silhouettes of shattered buildings piercing red clouds. Silence filled the streets—too still, too empty.
Beldarmore stayed close to Xekara, scanning every dark alley, every fallen structure.
“You’ve been quieter than usual,” he said.
“I am… unsettled,” she admitted. “These emotions… I do not understand them.”
“What emotions?”
She looked at him, eyes bright in the dim light. “When you are near, something shifts inside me. It is… unfamiliar.”
Beldarmore felt his breath catch slightly. “Xekara—”
A roar split the air..<br>.<br>.
<br>
A creature lunged from behind a collapsed wall—skin torn, ribs protruding, face twisted in rage.
Beldarmore shoved Xekara aside as the beast slammed into him.
He rolled, grabbed a metal pipe from the ground, dodged a claw swipe, and drove the pipe upward into its throat. The creature shrieked, stumbling, but Beldarmore surged forward, shoving the pipe deeper until the beast collapsed in a heap.
Xekara stared in shock. “You… killed it. Alone.”
Beldarmore breathed hard. “I told you. I’m learning.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Something flickered in her gaze—admiration, fear, and something even deeper.
“You grow stronger every day,” she whispered.
“Stronger than a human should.”
He didn’t understand what she meant, but before he could ask, the ground trembled with distant growls.
“We need to go,” Xekara said. “Now.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Return to Hillsville
Nightfall blanketed Hillsville as they returned. The survivors gathered around the fire, relieved.
Silas stepped forward. “We found something while you were gone.”
Corin nodded. “A military storage bunker. Not too far. Weapons, gear… maybe explosives.”
Milo beamed. “Guns, man. Actual guns!”
Damon whistled. “Well, well. Looks like Christmas came early.”
Beldarmore straightened. “We go at first light. I’ll choose a team.”
Damon crossed his arms. “You’re not leaving me behind.”
Beldarmore held his gaze, calm but firm. “We do this smart. No heroics, no ego.”
Damon smirked. “You say ego like it’s a bad thing.”
“It is,” Beldarmore said. “Especially now.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon raised a brow. “You know, for a guy who almost died a dozen times this month, you’re getting bossy.”
Beldarmore leaned closer. “The world ended weeks ago, Damon. Everything we knew is gone. We’re living on borrowed time. We adapt… or we die.”
Damon’s smirk faded, replaced by something more thoughtful.
He didn’t argue.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Xekara stepped beside Beldarmore, her shoulder barely touching his.
Heida watched from afar, hurt flickering behind her eyes.
Chiesniey’s jaw tightened slightly, unreadable.
And the fire cracked softly as the new team prepared for what came next—
Weapons, danger, jealousy, leadership…
And the shifting tides of the hearts around Beldarmore Valgra.
