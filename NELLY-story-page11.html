    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 11</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5: The Hillsville </br> (continued)</h2>
    <p1>Beldarmore shook his head. “Stop stirring trouble.”
“Stirring trouble is my hobby,” Damon said, then winked at Heida before strolling off to sharpen a stick.
Heida groaned softly. “He’s impossible.”
“You’re doing fine,” Beldarmore told her. His voice was warm without trying to be. She brightened instantly.
Xekara approached, stopping in front of Beldarmore. “You. With me.”
Chiesniey watched cautiously. Damon raised a brow. Heida bit her lip.
But Beldarmore followed Xekara to the edge of the clearing.
She pointed at a set of strange tracks shaped like elongated claws. “Do you see this?”
Beldarmore crouched. “These creatures from the rift?”
“Yes.” She lowered her voice. “They will come for you. All of you. But especially you.”
“Why me?”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Xekara hesitated—a rare moment. “Because the rift responds to strength. And whether you realize it or not, you carry strength.”
Beldarmore held her gaze. “Is that why you keep watching me?”
For the first time, Xekara blinked—caught off guard. A faint, quickly hidden flicker of emotion passed through her eyes.
“I watch everyone,” she said quietly. “But some… more closely.”
Their eyes held for a moment too long.
Then Heida called out from across the clearing, “Beldarmore! Can you help me with this?”
He turned, and Xekara’s expression hardened instantly, as though she had shut something inside her chest.
“Go,” she said. “Your people need you.”
Your people..<br>.<br>.
<br>
The words weighed on him.
He walked back to Heida, who smiled gratefully, cheeks flushing. “Thank you… I just needed help tying this.”
“You’re doing great,” he said softly.
Damon watched, leaning against a tree, arms crossed. “Leader, huh?”
Beldarmore sighed. “Just trying to survive.”
Damon smirked. “Yeah… well. Don’t expect me to salute you.”
“I won’t,” Beldarmore said. “I just expect you not to get us killed.”
Damon cracked a reluctant smile. “I’ll try. No promises.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Despite the tension, something had shifted between them—a thread of grudging respect.
As the sun descended behind the mountains and Hillsville fell into shadow, Beldarmore gathered the group.
“This is home now,” he said. “For tonight… and maybe longer. We stick together. We train. We adapt. And whatever comes out of that rift—” His eyes swept over each of them, lingering on Heida’s soft gaze, on Chiesniey’s steady determination, and on Xekara’s unreadable eyes. “—we face it as one.”
The forest wind whispered through the branches as if in agreement.
And Hillsville became their first true sanctuary.
For now.
