    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 19</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9: Hunting The Venom</h2>
    <p1> 
The forest was alive with a muted tension, the mist curling between the trees like a living thing, hiding shadows that moved too quickly to track. Beldarmore adjusted the straps of his makeshift armor, checking the weight of the guns and grenades they had scavenged. Each piece of equipment felt heavy, but necessary. Beside him, Damon was doing the same, grinning beneath a hood.
“You know,” Damon said, spinning the strap of a grenade lazily around his fingers, “if I die, just tell everyone I went out looking heroic. Preferably with dramatic music in the background.”
Beldarmore didn’t look up. “We aren’t going to die. We have a plan. Follow it, and keep your humor for later.”
Damon smirked. “Oh, don’t worry. I’ll keep it. I wouldn’t deprive the world of my genius for long.” He slung a rifle over his shoulder and fell in step beside Beldarmore. “Seriously though… heavy gear, dangerous creatures, a mysterious heroic friend—I feel like this is straight out of a movie. You ever think about that?”
Beldarmore glanced at him briefly. “Focus on the hunt. The creature won’t wait for dialogue.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Ah, focus. Heroic mantra. Got it.” Damon’s grin didn’t fade, but there was something steady in his gaze now. Preparedness, awareness… the kind of instinct Beldarmore couldn’t ignore. It made him pause, a strange warmth threading through his chest. He hadn’t expected to enjoy someone like this—not now, not while Sophie’s life was at stake—but Damon’s fearlessness, his humor, and uncanny ability to read the forest made him… dependable.
They moved through the trees, the ground soft with fallen needles, the mist occasionally brushing their cheeks. Every so often, Damon’s voice broke the silence.
“You know, I think the trees are plotting against us,” he whispered dramatically. “See that one? Definitely evil. That one? Evil with a vendetta. That one over there? Probably just misunderstood.”
Beldarmore exhaled slowly, resisting a small chuckle. “Keep talking. Keep us alive and sane. I’ll handle the actual survival part.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon leaned closer, lowering his voice. “You know, you’re kind of fun when you’re serious. Like… dangerously fun. I feel like if we survive this, I could actually—” He stopped, glancing at Beldarmore. “Well, you know. I’d probably die trying to say it properly anyway.”
Beldarmore’s steps faltered slightly. He didn’t respond, but he noticed the honesty beneath Damon’s teasing—the vulnerability hidden beneath the sarcasm. For a moment, he allowed himself to acknowledge it, a fleeting thought he immediately shoved aside. Sophie’s safety was his priority.
They reached a small clearing, where Damon knelt to check the ground. “Tracks,” he said, brushing dirt aside. “Fresh. Our friend’s been wandering this way. Big teeth, angry mood. Check, check, check. Perfect hunting conditions.”
Beldarmore crouched beside him, scanning the surrounding trees. “We catch it alive, drain its venom. No mistakes. If it gets away or kills someone…” His jaw tightened. “We won’t forgive ourselves.”
Damon nodded, unusually serious. “Understood, fearless leader. But just so we’re clear… you’re the brains, I’m the charm and occasional sarcasm?”
“Yes,” Beldarmore said, voice flat, though a tiny smirk threatened the corners of his mouth.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Good,” Damon said, standing and twirling a knife between his fingers. “Because if I’m going down, I’m going down looking ridiculously handsome. And making snarky comments. Heroic, yes, but stylish. You approve, right?”
Beldarmore didn’t reply. He felt the weight of responsibility pressing down, but beneath it, a small, unexpected comfort in having Damon at his side. Together, they were more than weapons and strength—they were a team.
As they moved through the thick forest, the conversation shifted, softer now, more candid.
“You ever get tired of being the serious hero type?” Damon asked quietly. “I mean, it’s exhausting pretending nothing scares you.”
Beldarmore glanced at him, eyes meeting his briefly. “It’s not pretending. It’s focus. Fear is a luxury we can’t afford. You’ve seen what happens when people let it control them.”
“Yeah,” Damon said, smiling faintly. “I’ve seen you in action. Heroic, infuriating, and terrifying all at once. Definitely terrifying.”
