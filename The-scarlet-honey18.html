         The morning after the suspension felt like a lifetime of silence. Nairobi’s rush hour buzzed outside, but inside Ida’s small apartment the world was still. The letter lay on the table like a wound—Suspended until further notice.
Nalani tried to speak hope into the air. “They’ll see the truth, my girl. A lie can’t stand forever.”
Ida nodded, though her throat burned. “I just don’t understand who’d do this, Mama.”
Ethan leaned on the doorway, arms crossed. “Someone scared of you, that’s who.”
Ephy came closer. “Then you have to fight. Go back, talk to them, clear your name.”
Ida looked up slowly, her eyes steady. “I will. I’m not done yet.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
At Skeem headquarters, Raim couldn’t focus. Every document he read blurred into Ida’s face—the disbelief in her eyes when she saw that forged signature. He’d told himself to stay detached, but the thought that someone might have set her up gnawed at him.
He pushed back his chair and called Damon. “Meet me in the archives. Now.”
Minutes later, Damon strolled in, casual as always. “You look like someone just canceled Christmas.”
Raim ignored the jab. “I want the original transaction sheets from hospitality. If the money really moved, there’ll be a digital trail.”
Damon arched an eyebrow. “Still defending your assistant?”
“She deserves fairness.”
Damon’s grin softened. “You always were the noble one.” He handed him a tablet. “Here. But you’ll want to see this too.”
He tapped the screen—Harriet Maverick’s company name appeared as one of the suppliers in a minor contract related to the hospitality fund.
Raim frowned. “Harriet?”
“Small catering deal last quarter,” Damon said. “Could be nothing. Could be something.”
Raim’s eyes darkened. “Find out.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Across town, in her gleaming Runda house, Harriet was enjoying a late breakfast when the doorbell rang. The guard opened it, and Damon Skeem stepped inside unannounced.
“Damon,” she said coolly. “To what do I owe this surprise?”
He looked around the room, smiling. “Still prefer your coffee black and your secrets sweet, I see.”
Her jaw tightened. “You shouldn’t be here.”
He walked to the window, unbothered. “Relax. I just came to reminisce. It’s been, what, three years since you walked out of that meeting at Monarch Holdings? You remember—where we both promised not to mention the little bookkeeping error?”
Her eyes flared. “Careful.”
He turned to her. “I’m not threatening you, Harriet. I’m reminding you. You start a fire in my family’s house, make sure your own files are flameproof.”
She crossed her arms. “You think I’m behind your little assistant’s mess?”
“I think,” he said softly, “you never do anything unless you gain from it.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
For a heartbeat they stared at each other, two predators in designer clothes. Then he smiled. “Good seeing you.”
When he left, Harriet’s hand trembled around her glass. If Damon remembered Monarch Holdings, she thought, then he could ruin everything.
By afternoon, she was in Regina’s office, voice low and calm. “You can’t let your sons be blinded by this girl. She’s already dividing them.”
Regina sighed. “Raim swears she’s innocent.”
“Of course he does,” Harriet said sweetly. “That’s how these things start—innocence, admiration, then scandal.”
Regina looked away. “This family doesn’t survive scandal.”
“Then act before it’s too late.”
As Harriet left, she glanced at her phone. A message from an unknown number blinked:
