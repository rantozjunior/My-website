    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 20</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9: Hunting The Venom <br> (continued) </h2>
    <p1>Beldarmore couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped. “You’re impossible.”
“Maybe. But you’re… tolerating me,” Damon replied. “Which I consider progress.”
They walked in silence for a moment, the forest around them alive with distant, unsettling noises. Then Damon broke it again, this time quieter, almost reflective.
“You know… you care about Sophie. I get it. But it’s kind of… weird. Watching you protect her, the way you—” He stopped, realizing he’d said too much. “Never mind. Don’t answer that.”
Beldarmore’s jaw tightened slightly. “I do care. That doesn’t change what we have to do.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“I know,” Damon said softly, a rare seriousness threading his usual humor. “I just… don’t usually see someone carry so much. Responsibility, guilt, care… It’s impressive. And exhausting. Guess you really are the forest king.”
Beldarmore glanced at him, the corners of his mouth twitching. “Careful. Flattery will not save you if the creature finds us first.”
Damon grinned, sheathing the knife. “Then I’ll just have to be even more charming while we kill it. Multitasking, you know?”
For the first time, Beldarmore felt a strange relief. In the midst of the hunt, the sarcasm, the tension… having Damon at his side made the impossible feel manageable.
They reached a small ravine, ideal for trapping the creature.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“This is where we catch it,” Beldarmore whispered, kneeling to set a crude snare using rope and logs. “We pin it down, remove its fangs carefully, and drain the venom. One mistake, and we lose it—or worse.”
Damon crouched beside him, rolling his eyes dramatically. “You sound so professional. Honestly, I think you missed your calling as a theatrical hero instructor.”
“Focus,” Beldarmore said, tightening the trap.
“Yes, sir,” Damon replied, smirking but moving with precision. “Focus, trap, save lives, drink heroic satisfaction later. Got it.”
They worked in silence now, each aware of the other’s strengths. Damon’s casual confidence complemented Beldarmore’s strict control. They were ready.
The forest waited with bated breath, shadows deepening, the creature unaware that its fate was about to be sealed.
The forest thickened as they approached the ravine’s edge. The air grew colder, heavier, carrying a familiar stench—rot, musk, and something metallic, like rusted blood. Damon froze mid-step, eyes narrowing.
“There,” he whispered..<br>.<br>.
<br>
The creature lurked just beyond the treeline. Taller than a man, lean, with sinewy muscle stretched over a bony frame. Its skin was pale and cracked like old stone, its eyes glowing faintly. It twitched, sniffing the air, searching.
Damon leaned slightly toward Beldarmore. “Okay, so… when you said ‘alive,’ I thought we meant something slightly smaller. Maybe less murderous.”
Beldarmore didn’t respond. His gaze was locked on the creature. “Follow the plan.”
“Right, right. Plan. Trap the nightmare. Not die. Perfect.”
They crept forward, silent as ghosts. The creature moved, sniffing, steps light but precise. Its claws clicked against stone, and Damon tensed.
Beldarmore gave a quick hand signal.
Damon flicked a stone.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
It clattered loudly across the ravine.
The creature’s head snapped toward the noise.
In one motion, Beldarmore lunged forward and kicked the release mechanism. The vines, logs, and weighted branches snapped into motion, slamming down on the creature with brutal force.
The beast screeched—a sharp, bone-deep sound that vibrated through the trees—struggling violently against the trap. Damon rushed in, grabbing its arm and pinning it with his knee.
“Hold it still!” Beldarmore shouted..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“WHAT DO YOU THINK I’M DOING? DANCING WITH IT?” Damon yelled back, wrestling the creature’s claws away from his throat.
Beldarmore jammed a spear through its arm, anchoring it to the ground. The monster thrashed again, but it was trapped.
Breathing hard, Damon pushed his hair back. “Next time, can we hunt something friendlier? A giant rabbit maybe?”
Ignoring the comment, Beldarmore pulled out a sharpened bone-handled knife. “I have to remove the fangs intact. Hold its head steady.”
Damon gulped. “Yep. No pressure. Just casually holding the jaws of death.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Together, they forced the creature’s jaw open. Its saliva hissed as it dripped onto the forest floor, burning small patches of grass.
Beldarmore worked carefully, slicing the gumline around each fang. It took long minutes—painstaking, precise, dangerous.
Snap.
The first fang came free.
