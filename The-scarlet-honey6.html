         Ida smiled politely and entered the elevator. Her heart pounded as the numbers climbed — 1... 2... 3...
The doors opened to the same floor she’d seen before — elegant, quiet, powerful.
She was shown to her desk — small but clean, tucked near the window where she could see the entire city stretching out like a promise.
She sat down, taking it all in.
A shadow fell across her desk — she looked up and saw Raim Skeem standing there, holding a cup of coffee.
“Welcome to the team, Miss Mbona,” he said, his voice calm but kind.
“Thank you, sir,” she replied softly.
He smiled faintly and turned away — just as Damon Skeem appeared behind him, grinning.
“Well, well. So they actually hired you.”
“Yes, sir,” Ida said cautiously..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Don’t call me sir. Makes me sound old,” Damon said with a smirk. “You’ll get used to this place. Just… watch your back. Not everyone smiles for the right reasons.”
Raim gave him a look, but Damon just winked and walked away.
Ida watched them both — two brothers, the same blood, yet completely different.
Angled her right into their world.
As she turned back to her desk, the faintest smile crossed her lips.
