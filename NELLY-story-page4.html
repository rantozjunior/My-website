    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 4 </h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2: Under The Broken Sky (Continued)</h2>
    <p1>Beldarmore pushed Heida forward, then moved to help clear the debris. Their hands worked together, lifting broken pieces of concrete, straining muscles and aching joints, until the stairwell was accessible. They slipped inside, gasping for air, the cool darkness of the underground station a stark contrast to the chaos above.
Heida sank against the wall, tears streaking her dusty face. “I… I can’t believe we made it.”
Beldarmore knelt beside her, brushing a lock of hair from her forehead. “Believe it. You’re alive, and that’s what matters.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Chiesniey crouched near the entrance, scanning the darkness ahead. “We’ll be safe for now,” she said. “But we can’t stay here too long. There’s no telling what those things will send next.”
Beldarmore’s gaze drifted to the faint glow of violet light above the broken entrance where Xekara had disappeared. “And her… we can’t count on her either. But maybe… maybe she’s a sign we’re not completely alone.”
Heida looked up at him, searching his face. “You… trust her?”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“I don’t know,” Beldarmore admitted, voice low. “But we have to survive first. Questions come later.”
The three of them moved deeper into the station. The distant roars above reminded them of the chaos still raging outside. Beldarmore could feel the pulse of the city through the concrete beneath his boots. Every sound, every vibration, seemed magnified, every shadow a potential threat.
Heida’s hand brushed against his as they stepped over a broken railing. Their fingers lingered for just a moment, a brief comfort in the nightmare around them. Beldarmore felt warmth spread through his chest, a strange mix of fear, protectiveness, and… something else.
Chiesniey’s voice broke the moment. “Stay alert. We’re not safe yet.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
He nodded. “I know. But for now… we breathe. We survive. And we move forward.”
Above them, the rift pulsed, a wound in the sky that promised more horrors to come. Yet, for the first time since it had appeared, Beldarmore felt a flicker of hope. They were alive, together. And as long as that was true, survival wasn’t impossible.
Somewhere in the shadows, Xekara watched. And Beldarmore knew, without understanding why, that their fates were bound together now.
The world above was broken. The city was dying. But down here, in the darkness, they had a chance.
A chance to survive.
And perhaps… a chance to fight back.
