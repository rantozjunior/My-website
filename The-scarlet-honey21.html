         But before he could continue, the HR director entered holding a printout. “Sir, we found confirmation. The last remote login to Miss Mbona’s account originated from Mark Onyango’s terminal.”
Silence.
Harriet lowered her eyes, as if disappointed by her own accuracy. “How unfortunate.”
By the end of the day, Mark Onyango was escorted out by security—bewildered, pleading, swearing innocence. The Skeem family made no statement, but the message was clear: order restored, scandal averted.
Harriet stood by the glass balcony that night, looking down at the city’s neon veins. She exhaled slowly, the taste of victory faint but satisfying.
Three days later, Ida was called back.
Raim met her in the hallway outside the boardroom. His expression was softer than she’d seen in weeks.
“You’re cleared,” he said quietly. “They found who did it.”
Her eyes widened. “Mark?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
He nodded. “Apparently, he accessed your terminal without permission. You’re reinstated—no charges.”
Ida’s chest tightened. “But I never—he wouldn’t do that.”
“I know,” Raim said. “But sometimes truth loses to proof.”
She looked at him then, really looked—at the tiredness behind his eyes, the weight of what he carried. For the first time since it began, she saw how deeply it had hurt him too.
“I’m sorry you had to defend me,” she said softly..<br>.<br>.
<br>
He smiled faintly. “I didn’t defend you. I just refused to doubt you.”
By the next week, Ida Mbona returned to work. The whispers had changed tone now—part awe, part apology.
Raim had quietly arranged something else: a new workspace.
When she walked into the executive floor, a small brass plaque gleamed beside a door:
Ida Mbona — Special Assistant to the Executive Director.
Her office was modest but bright, with a view of the city skyline. And just beyond the glass partition, she could see Raim’s office—close enough for a shared glance, far enough to stay professional.
She stood there in silence for a moment, smiling.
Ephy’s voice echoed in her memory: “You’re going to work in one of those shiny offices one day.”
She whispered to herself, “You were right, little sister.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
TWO MONTHS LATER 
The Skeem Experience had launched successfully. Nairobi buzzed with life—late-night cafés, rooftop music, art nights—all under Skeem Mall’s name. Crowds filled the plaza long after sunset, and Ida’s vision had become the city’s heartbeat.
The Skeems were thriving again. Yet something new pulsed beneath that success—something tender and uncertain.
Raim had grown quieter around her. Softer. His usual calm replaced by a warmth that showed in small ways—a look held too long, a question that lingered.
One evening, after the last meeting, he found her still at her desk, staring at the city lights.
“You never stop working,” he said gently.
She smiled. “Neither do you.”
He stepped closer, his reflection merging with hers in the glass. “I used to work for legacy. Now I think I work for meaning.”
She looked up. “And have you found it?”
