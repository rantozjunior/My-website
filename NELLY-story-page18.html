    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 18</h1>
    <h2>Chapter : The Cure And Confession </br> (continued) </h2>
    <p1>Finally, they applied the mixture to Sophie’s wounds. Her breathing slowed, and the fever that had consumed her body began to ease. Color returned to her cheeks, though pale. The relief was visible on everyone’s faces, but Beldarmore remained alert, knowing the cure was only temporary.
“She’s stabilized,” Xekara said softly, brushing her hair from her face. “But the infection remains in her veins.”
Beldarmore nodded. “Temporary. It’s a start.”
Heida exhaled, gripping his hand. “Thank you… for everything you do.”
He turned to her briefly, his eyes meeting hers. “We survive together. That’s what matters now.”
   . </br>.

Later, exhausted, Beldarmore drifted into a deep sleep by the dying fire. The vision came swiftly.
He was alone in a dark cavern, the creature that had bitten Sophie standing before him. Its fangs gleamed in the dim light, and its eyes were black voids of rage. He knelt beside it, carefully removing its elongated fangs. The venom inside glowed faintly, pulsating like liquid fire.
In the vision, he boiled the venom over a small flame. The liquid hissed and shimmered. Without hesitation, he drank it. Pain, weakness, and the dull ache that had lingered in his body vanished. Strength and clarity surged through him. He could feel every cell in his body revitalized.
Xekara’s voice echoed in his mind. This… is the cure. You must take it..<br>.<br>.
<br>
He awoke with a start, chest heaving, sweat soaking his hair. The forest was quiet, the fire reduced to embers. The vision had left a clear knowledge, a burning certainty. The venom from the creature could cure Sophie—but obtaining it would be dangerous.
Heida stirred, sitting up and stretching, still asleep-eyed but aware of his tension. “Beldarmore?” she whispered.
“I… I had a vision,” he admitted softly. “A way to cure her completely. But I have to go alone.”
Heida’s hands flew to his arms, eyes wide. “Alone? That’s—impossible. You can’t!”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Xekara, still watching from under the tree outside the tent, silently acknowledged his decision. She understood the risk but did not intervene. Her eyes reflected the silver moonlight, her feelings unspoken but profound.
Damon stirred, leaning lazily against a log, muttering, “Well, of course you want to go alone. Classic heroic solo adventure. Nothing ever goes wrong in those, right?”
Heida shot him a glare, but Beldarmore held up a hand. “This is necessary. I’ll return.”
Her eyes searched his, her heart heavy, but she finally nodded. “Just… come back. Please.”
Beldarmore gave her a faint, reassuring smile. “I will.”
As the night deepened and the fire dwindled, the forest around Hillsville whispered in anticipation. The team rested, fragile and exhausted, while the weight of what was to come pressed upon them all. Sophie slept fitfully, her breaths shallow but stable. Heida and Xekara remained silent, each struggling with emotions they dared not voice. And Beldarmore Valgra, burdened with responsibility, courage, and the unspoken desires of those around him, prepared to face the darkness alone to save a life—and perhaps, in the process, claim his own.
