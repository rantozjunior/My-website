    <p1>CHAPTER EIGHT — THE CURE AND THE CONFESSION
The night had settled over Hillsville like a soft, suffocating blanket, thick with mist and the faint scent of pine. A pale moon filtered through the canopy, casting thin silver lines across the forest floor. The survivors moved quietly, their exhausted bodies and minds weighed down by the day’s ordeal. Sophie lay on the man-made bed, her small form trembling under a thin blanket, the infection darkening her veins beneath pale skin.
Beldarmore sat beside her, shoulders tense, scanning her condition. His fingers brushed hers, steadying her trembling hand. Heida crouched on the other side, her hands lightly resting on Sophie’s arm, offering warmth and comfort. Her eyes kept flicking to Beldarmore, glinting with something deeper than fear or survival.
Damon leaned against a tree, arms crossed, muttering under his breath. “I swear, if I have to use sarcasm to survive one more day, I’ll—well, I’ll probably still survive. But man, the dramatic tension is killing me.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Heida shot him a glare that could have cut steel. Beldarmore didn’t react. He could feel the subtle pull from both women, the unspoken desire threading the air between them. Heida’s warmth, her subtle touches, and Xekara’s intense gaze from the shadowed trees—it was all there. He let it slip aside. Survival came first.
“Beldarmore,” Heida whispered, her voice almost breaking. “I… I can’t—” She swallowed hard, glancing at Sophie. “I can’t hold it in anymore. I love you.”
The words hit him like a cold wind. His chest tightened, and for a moment he had no answer. Heida’s eyes were wide and hopeful, vulnerable in a way that made his heart ache.
Before he could respond, a movement in the shadows caught his attention. Xekara stood near the tree line, silent, watching. She had approached, intending perhaps to step inside the tent, but now she stopped. Her silver eyes reflected the moonlight, shimmering with a mix of longing and restraint. She did not step closer; instead, she sank to the base of the tree, folding her legs beneath her, invisible to all but Beldarmore.
Heida’s voice trembled again. “You don’t have to say anything… I just—”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Beldarmore’s hand found hers, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I hear you,” he said softly. “I… I know.”
Damon rolled his eyes, leaning forward on the log. “Awww. How romantic. I’ll just be over here, holding the sarcasm flag, in case anyone needs a laugh while the world burns.”
“Shut up,” Heida said, and Damon grinned, ignoring the glare.
The group needed a solution, and Beldarmore knew Damon had a sharp mind beneath the sarcasm..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Damon,” Beldarmore said, voice firm, “I need you to find a way to stabilize her. Go into the forest, gather herbs—anything you think might work.”
“Ah, yes,” Damon said, standing and brushing dirt from his pants. “My specialty: the ‘probably-not-poisonous-but-we’ll-see’ herbal concoction. Exciting times.” He gave Beldarmore a look, half smirk, half challenge. “I’ll be back with a miracle—or at least something that doesn’t kill her.”
Heida watched him go, frowning slightly. “Do you think he’ll find anything?”
Beldarmore’s gaze was on Sophie. “He has to. She needs it.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Xekara remained silent, eyes fixed on the moonlight filtering through the trees. She tugged her cloak tighter around her shoulders, quiet and contemplative, yet painfully aware of the tension between Heida and herself. Both women wanted him. Both had subtly claimed pieces of his attention. And Beldarmore, unwavering, kept his focus on survival and Sophie.
Damon moved quickly, moving deeper into the forest with practiced ease. His sarcasm faded, replaced with sharp focus, eyes scanning the undergrowth. He collected leaves, roots, and flowers, his mind cataloging what could heal and what could harm. He returned hours later, the forest still dark, his arms full of crude bundles.
“I have no idea if this will work,” he said, tossing the herbs to Beldarmore. “But hey, miracles are my second-best talent. First is sarcasm, obviously.”
Beldarmore and Xekara set to work, grinding and mixing, using heat from a small fire to create a paste. Heida held Sophie’s hand, her thumb brushing over her wrist, murmuring soft words of comfort. Damon assisted, muttering occasional jokes about their culinary skills, but his hands moved deftly.
