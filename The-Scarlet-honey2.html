           The matatu screeched to a stop at Lavington, and Ida stepped out, blinking against the sudden shift of worlds.
The roads here were wide and clean. The air smelled different — faintly of perfume, freshly cut grass, and expensive cars gliding by like silent beasts.
Ahead of her, The Skeem Mall shimmered like a dream.
Glass walls glinted under the morning sun, fountains danced in perfect symmetry, and the massive golden letters “THE SKEEM MALL” stood proudly above the entrance.
Ida’s breath caught. For a moment, she simply stood there, her reflection caught in the glass — a girl from Kawangware in a secondhand blouse, holding her dreams in a small handbag.
She swallowed hard and walked in..<br>.<br>.
<br>
The lobby was vast and gleaming — marble floors that clicked under her shoes, a soft scent of jasmine in the air, and people dressed in tailored suits gliding past with phones pressed to their ears.
Ida felt small but determined. She walked up to the reception desk where a young woman with sharp nails and a colder smile looked up.
“Excuse me,” Ida said softly. “I’m here for an interview with the management.”
The receptionist’s eyes flicked up and down, her tone polite but distant.
“Name?”
“Ida Mbona.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Wait there, Miss Mbona. Someone will attend to you shortly.”
Ida nodded and stepped aside. She clutched her handbag tighter, trying not to stare at everything — the golden elevators, the art on the walls, the quiet hum of power.
Then the elevator doors opened, and out walked Raim Skeem.
Tall, calm, and effortlessly handsome, Raim’s presence drew eyes without him trying. His suit was perfectly cut, his steps confident, his gaze deep and unreadable.
He spoke quietly into his phone, his voice smooth like silk.
“Yes, Father. I’ll review the proposals before the board meeting. No, Damon hasn’t shown up yet.”
When he hung up, his eyes accidentally met Ida’s.
Just for a moment.
Time slowed.
She looked away quickly, her heart racing. There was something about his gaze — kind, yet searching, as if he could see right through her.
Raim frowned slightly, curious. Most people avoided eye contact in the Skeem Mall; this girl had met his eyes without fear.
He turned to the receptionist..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Is this the interview candidate for the assistant position?”
“Yes, sir. Miss Ida Mbona.”
“Send her up.”
The receptionist looked startled.
“But, sir—she hasn’t—”
“Now,” Raim said gently but firmly.
Ida followed him into the elevator, her palms sweating. The elevator glided upward silently. She could see the city spreading below — a sea of rooftops and highways.
When the doors opened, Raim led her into a sleek conference room. The walls were glass, offering a panoramic view of Nairobi’s skyline.
