        <p>“Ah,” he murmured. “So you’ve seen real life. That’s good. Most people here only pretend to live.”
Regina shot him a warning look.
“Damon.”
He raised his hands in mock surrender.
“Alright, alright. Just saying she’s got presence.”
Raim sighed quietly, but he couldn’t hide a small smile. Damon always had a way of causing chaos — and sometimes, saying truths others wouldn’t.
Regina closed the folder.
“We’ll be in touch, Miss Mbona. Thank you for your time.”
Ida nodded politely and stood. As she left, Damon’s voice followed her out:
“Something tells me we’ll see her again.”
Raim glanced at him..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“You think so?”
“I know so.” Damon smirked. “That one’s going to change things.”
Ida stepped back into the sunlight, her heart pounding. She didn’t know whether to smile or cry. The interview had gone better than she expected — or maybe worse.
Still, something in her gut told her life was about to shift.
She looked back one last time at The Skeem Mall, its glass reflecting the clouds. Somewhere inside, two brothers — one kind, one dangerous — were already thinking about her.
She didn’t know it yet, but from this day forward, nothing in her world — or theirs — would ever be the same.
The matatu ride back to Kawangware felt longer than usual. Ida sat quietly by the window, her reflection flickering against the city passing by — endless traffic, street vendors, and the distant hum of a life much larger than hers.
Her mind was spinning..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Did she say the right words?
Did they like her?
Would they really call?
She looked down at her phone — the small, cracked-screen Nokia that had seen better days. She whispered to herself, half-praying, half-dreaming,
“Please, God… just this once.”
That evening, as the sun melted into orange across the rooftops of Kawangware, the family gathered around their small wooden table. Nalani was serving ugali and sukuma wiki, Ephy was talking about school, and Ethan was telling another exaggerated story about how he “almost” got a job fixing motorbikes in town.
The room was full of chatter — until Ida’s phone began to buzz.
Her heart skipped. She looked at the screen: “Unknown Number.”
“Eh, pick it up!” Ephy squealed. “Maybe it’s those mall people!”
Ida pressed Answer, her hand shaking.
“Hello?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
A calm, professional voice came through.
“Good evening. Is this Miss Ida Mbona?”
“Yes, this is she.”
“This is Rachel from The Skeem Mall HR department. We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected for the assistant position. You’ll report to the management office tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.”
For a second, she couldn’t breathe.
