          “You’re nervous,” Raim said without looking at her.
“A little,” Ida admitted, her voice trembling. “It’s… a lot to take in.”
He smiled faintly.
“You’ll get used to it. Everyone does — eventually.”
The doors opened to the executive floor. Plush carpets, floor-to-ceiling windows, and paintings that probably cost more than her entire neighborhood.
They entered a glass-walled office. Inside sat Regina Skeem, elegant and sharp-eyed, and Ginette Skeem, Raim’s older sister — poised, beautiful, but intimidating.
Regina’s voice was calm but assessing.
“So, Miss Mbona. You’re applying for the assistant role under our administrative department?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Ida said softly..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Regina adjusted her glasses, skimming through Ida’s CV — handwritten, neatly folded, simple.
“You have no formal experience in high-end retail or corporate management?”
“No, ma’am,” Ida replied, her hands clasped tightly. “But I learn fast. I’m disciplined, and I know what it means to work hard.”
Ginette’s lips curved slightly — not unkind, but skeptical.
“Discipline is good. But this environment can be… challenging. Are you sure you can handle it?”
Ida met her gaze steadily.
“I’ve handled worse.”
For a moment, silence filled the room. Raim’s eyes softened.
Regina finally leaned back, studying her..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“You remind me of someone I knew a long time ago.”
Then, unexpectedly, the door burst open — and in swaggered Damon Skeem.
If Raim was calm and composed, Damon was chaos wrapped in charm.
He wore a dark leather jacket instead of a suit, sunglasses perched on his head, and a smirk that said he’d never lost a battle he didn’t start himself.
“Mother, sister, brother,” he greeted lazily. “Sorry to interrupt your royal court. Who’s the guest?”
Raim’s voice was calm..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Damon, we’re conducting an interview.”
Damon’s eyes flicked to Ida — and lingered. A slow smile spread across his face.
“An interview, huh? Well, this one’s got fire in her eyes.”
Ida felt her cheeks flush but stood her ground.
“Good morning, sir.”
“Morning,” Damon said, amused. “You from around here?”
“Kawangware,” she said simply.
