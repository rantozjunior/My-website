            “An assistant, I think. Ida Mbona, was it? Pretty girl, from Kawangware. Brilliant, they say.”
Regina’s expression didn’t change, but her hand tightened on the cup.
“Oh, don’t mind me,” Harriet continued, feigning innocence. “I just find it fascinating how quickly some people rise when they… catch the right eye.”
The comment landed like a seed in fresh soil. Regina laughed politely, but the question stayed behind her eyes.
Harriet hid a smile behind her cup. Stage one complete.

At Skeem Mall, Damon leaned against a balcony rail, watching Ida lead a small team through new staff orientations. Her calm authority surprised him. He wasn’t used to seeing people from outside their circle move with such confidence in their world.
When she dismissed the group, he sauntered over. “You handle them well,” he said.
She looked up, startled. “Mr. Skeem. Thank you.”
“Damon,” he corrected. “You can call me Damon.”
She hesitated. “Alright… Damon.”
He grinned. “See? That wasn’t hard.”
His eyes glimmered with something playful, almost dangerous. “You know, I didn’t think Raim had it in him to spot talent like yours. You’re… different.”
She didn’t know how to answer. “I just want to do my work.”
“That’s what they all say,” he murmured, half to himself.
Before she could respond, he was gone.
From a nearby corridor, someone watched—Harriet’s assistant, taking discreet photos.

That evening, Raim found Ida in the break room, still poring over reports.
“You’re supposed to go home sometimes,” he teased.
“I will,” she said. “Just finishing the staffing sheet.”
He sat opposite her. “I like how you don’t quit.”
She looked up. “Sometimes you can’t afford to.”
He studied her quietly, then nodded. “I understand.”
There was a pause—comfortable, warm. She felt seen, truly seen, in a way that frightened and thrilled her at once.
Then Raim’s phone buzzed: a message from Regina.
 Come home. We need to talk about your new assistant.
---.<br>.<br>.

Night settled over Nairobi. In Runda, Regina waited in the family study, arms crossed. Damon lounged on the sofa, scrolling through photos Harriet had sent anonymously. Blurred shots of Ida and Raim at the restaurant, papers between them, a shared smile, a candlelight reflection.
Regina looked up when Raim entered. “Care to explain these?”
He frowned, taking the phone. “This was dinner. We were discussing the proposal.”
Damon smirked. “Looks more like a date to me, brother.”
“Enough,” Raim snapped.
