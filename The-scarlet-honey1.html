    <h2> Chapter 1: The Ida Simple Family</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>
            Morning in Kawangware was always loud — a melody of matatu horns, hawkers shouting prices, children running to school, and the rhythm of a city that never really slept.
The smell of chai and mandazis filled the air as the first light painted the tin roofs gold.
Inside a modest two-room house tucked behind the market, the Mbona family was already awake..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Nalani Mbona, their mother, moved with quiet grace, wrapping her leso tightly around her waist as she packed tomatoes, onions, and avocados into a crate for her stall. Her hands were calloused, her back tired, but her spirit unbroken.
“Ephy! Bring that sack of potatoes — and hurry before the customers beat me to the stall!” Nalani called, her voice strong but affectionate.
From the inner room came the cheerful voice of Ephy Mbona, the youngest daughter.
“Coming, Mama! You act like I’m the one who made time move faster!”
Nalani shook her head, hiding a smile. Ephy was her sunshine — stubborn, talkative, and always finding joy where others saw struggle.
At the door, Ethan Mbona was leaning on the wooden frame, lacing up his old sneakers.
He looked up, grinning..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Mama, don’t stress Ephy. She’s just making sure she looks nice for the conductor who gave her free fare yesterday.”
“Ah Ethan!” Ephy shouted from inside, laughing and throwing a slipper at him. “Keep my name out of your jokes!”
Their laughter filled the house, small as it was — laughter that made the cracked walls feel warm.
But in the corner, quiet and thoughtful, sat Ida Mbona, their eldest. Her dark eyes were fixed on a neatly folded envelope. She had read it a hundred times already, tracing each word as if they might disappear.
“Dear Miss Mbona, you are invited for an interview at The Skeem Mall…”
Those words carried both hope and fear. The Skeem Mall — everyone in Nairobi knew it. The glass towers, the polished floors, the cars that cost more than entire estates. It was owned by the Skeem family — a name whispered with both envy and respect.
Ida stood, smoothing her secondhand blouse. Her heart beat faster than she wanted to admit. She walked out and handed the letter to her mother.
Nalani adjusted her reading glasses, squinting at the paper.
“The Skeem Mall?” she murmured, her voice laced with awe. “Eh, my child, God’s hand is truly at work.”
Ephy peeked over her mother’s shoulder, eyes wide..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Ida! The Skeem Mall? The one with those big escalators and a cinema? Eeeh! You’re going to meet rich people!”
Ethan whistled low, shaking his head.
“Just don’t forget to wave at us from the TV when they make you manager.”
Ida laughed, though her voice trembled.
“You two think it’s that easy? It’s just an interview.”
Nalani set the letter down gently.
“No, Ida. It’s more than that. It’s a door. And sometimes, all a person needs is one door to open.”
For a long moment, the family stood silent — the weight of her mother’s words filling the room.
Ida turned toward the small mirror hanging on the wall. Her reflection looked both familiar and strange — the girl from Kawangware who dared to dream beyond its dusty borders. She straightened her hair, adjusted her skirt, and whispered to herself,
“I can do this.”
Outside, a matatu blared its horn. The conductor’s voice rang through the street:
“Town! Westie! Lavington! One seat! Harakisha!”
Nalani pressed a few coins into Ida’s hand — all she could spare..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Go, my daughter. Make us proud. But remember, money doesn’t make you better than anyone — it only shows who you truly are.”
Ida hugged her mother tightly, breathing in the scent of home — soap, earth, and warmth.
Ephy ran to her, eyes shining.
“When you get there, tell me if the floors shine like mirrors.”
Ethan ruffled her hair, teasing softly.
“And if you meet a rich man, tell him Ethan said hi.”
Ida laughed, stepping out into the morning sunlight. The streets buzzed with life — vendors calling out prices, motorbikes weaving between cars, schoolchildren chasing each other through puddles.
She climbed into the matatu, sitting by the window. As it rumbled toward The Skeem Mall, she watched Kawangware fade behind her — its chaos, its laughter, its love.
Her mother’s words echoed in her mind.
“Don’t forget who you are.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
For the first time, Ida wasn’t just dreaming about a better life — she was heading straight into it. She didn’t know that behind the mall’s shining glass and clean marble floors waited the world of the Skeems, a family whose power and secrets would soon change everything.
The matatu joined the highway, the skyline of Nairobi rising ahead — tall, beautiful, and dangerous.
Ida took a deep breath and smiled faintly.
Today, she wasn’t just another girl from Kawangware.
Today, she was Ida Mbona, chasing her destiny.
