    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 5</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3: Into The Depths</h2>
    <p1>The subway smelled of damp concrete and rusted metal. Pigeons stirred nervously in the shadows above, cooing and flapping their wings as Beldarmore Valgra, Heida Skeem, and Chiesniey Marga descended the cracked steps. Every footstep echoed through the empty tunnels, amplifying the sense of isolation.
Beldarmore’s chest ached from the run through the city streets, but adrenaline kept him sharp. The rift above had been relentless, spewing monstrosities that defied logic. The memory of their razor-edged limbs and glowing eyes made his fingers curl instinctively around the straps of his backpack.
Heida sank against the wall, shivering. “I can’t believe… I can’t believe we made it this far,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the underground.
Beldarmore knelt beside her. “You made it,” he said softly. “And that’s what counts. We’ll deal with everything else later.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Chiesniey scanned the tunnel ahead, rifle ready. Her movements were calm, precise, and completely focused. “We need to find a secure chamber,” she said. “The farther we go from the street, the less likely they’ll follow immediately.”
Beldarmore glanced around. The tunnel walls were scarred with soot and debris. Broken benches and fallen signs littered the platform. Rusted tracks disappeared into darkness. Somewhere down the tunnel, water dripped with a steady rhythm, echoing like a metronome.
Heida shivered again. “Do we even know what’s out there?”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“We know enough to run,” Beldarmore said. “That’s step one. Step two… survive.”
A sudden vibration passed through the floor. Dust fell from the ceiling. Beldarmore froze. Chiesniey’s grip tightened on her rifle.
[Threat Detected: Unknown Entities Approaching]
Heida grabbed his arm. “They found us?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Not yet,” Beldarmore said, voice calm. But inside, his pulse raced. Stay alert. Stay alive.
The system’s familiar chime echoed faintly in his mind. He exhaled sharply. “Seems I’m not alone in this,” he murmured.
Chiesniey moved first, signaling for them to follow. They slipped past abandoned turnstiles and shattered kiosks, deeper into the tunnel network. The further they went, the cooler and damper the air became. Shadows stretched unnaturally along the walls, moving as if they had minds of their own.
Suddenly, the faint shimmer of violet light appeared at the far end of the platform. Xekara.
She didn’t speak, but the air around her pulsed. The creatures outside—whatever they were—stopped short as though her presence alone commanded attention. Her violet eyes scanned the shadows, and for a fleeting moment, she looked directly at Beldarmore. A shiver ran down his spine.
Heida whispered, “She… she’s watching us again.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Beldarmore nodded. “Yeah. And I think she’s making sure we stay alive… for now.”
Chiesniey’s tone was sharp. “We don’t have time to interpret signals. Move.”
As they pressed deeper into the subway, a low rumble echoed from the tunnels ahead. Something massive approached. Beldarmore’s stomach tightened.
[Threat Level: High].<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Stay close,” he muttered to Heida. His hand brushed hers briefly, instinctively steadying her. There was an unspoken connection in that touch—a silent promise that he wouldn’t let anything happen to her.
The rumble grew louder, and then shapes appeared in the darkness: monsters emerging from the shadows, their elongated limbs scraping the walls, glowing eyes sweeping the tunnel. Beldarmore could feel the vibrations through his boots. Every instinct screamed attack, survive, run.
Chiesniey moved like a shadow, precise and deadly. She took careful shots at the closest creatures, her rifle’s sharp reports echoing through the tunnels. Sparks flew as bullets ricocheted off metal surfaces, illuminating their faces in brief, stuttering flashes.
Beldarmore instinctively ducked, pulling Heida behind him. He glanced at Xekara, who had materialized above the advancing creatures on a beam of broken concrete. With one motion, she released a pulse of energy that sent several monsters flying backward into the tunnel walls. The violet glow flickered over Beldarmore’s face. He couldn’t look away.
“She’s incredible,” Heida whispered, awe and fear tangled in her voice.
“Yeah,” Beldarmore said softly. “And terrifying.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
A particularly massive shadow lunged toward them. Its claws glinted in the dim light, sharp and curved. Beldarmore reacted instinctively, shoving Heida to the side and diving toward a pile of rubble. Pain shot through his shoulder as the creature’s claw grazed him, tearing fabric and skin. He hissed but didn’t stop. Survival came first.
[System Alert: Injury Detected – Shoulder]
[Healing Protocol Available: Activate?]
Beldarmore froze. The voice inside his head, mechanical and calm, offered solutions. He ignored the pain, relying on instinct and the system’s subtle guidance. Movement was priority..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Chiesniey dispatched the creature with precise shots. Beldarmore looked back and saw Heida staring at him, eyes wide with worry. “Are you okay?” she asked.
“I will be,” he said, voice tight but reassuring. “Just keep moving.”
