         Regina’s tone was icy. “We are not a gossip column, Raim. The Skeem name carries weight. You cannot afford—none of us can afford—rumors.”
“There’s nothing improper,” he said evenly. “She’s talented, professional, and the project is thriving.”
“Be careful that talent isn’t mistaken for ambition,” Regina replied. “People talk.”
He left without another word, anger simmering beneath his calm.

The next morning, Ida arrived early again. The security guard looked uneasy.
“Miss Mbona,” he said, “I was told to inform you—there’s a problem.”
She frowned. “What kind of problem?”
He pointed toward the boardroom. Inside, two HR officers and Regina herself were examining a file.
Raim wasn’t there.
“Miss Mbona,” Regina said coolly as Ida entered. “We’ve received concerning reports. Company funds missing from the hospitality budget—your signature on the release form.”
Ida blinked. “What? That’s impossible. I never—”
Regina slid the document across the table. It was her signature, copied perfectly.
Her stomach turned cold. “This is forged.”.<br>.<br>.

“I hope so,” Regina said. “Because if not, you’ll be suspended pending investigation.”
The words echoed in her ears. She looked around, searching for someone to defend her—but all eyes were cold.
When she finally stumbled out of the room, the corridors that had once felt golden now seemed endless and gray.
Somewhere, in the distance, Harriet Maverick closed her laptop, satisfaction soft in her smile.
 “Stage two,” she whispered. “Let’s see how long the light lasts.”

Ida stood outside the glass doors of Skeem Mall, the city buzzing beyond. For the first time, the place she’d helped build felt foreign. She clutched the falsified document, heart heavy, and whispered to herself,
 “Someone’s coming for me… and I don’t even know why.”
The neon sign above her flickered: SKEEM MALL – WHERE NAIROBI MEETS THE NIGHT.
She looked up, tears in her eyes, and whispered, “Not tonight.”
