    <h2> Chapter 4:  Dinner At The Skeem Mansion</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>
         The Skeem Mansion stood like a jewel in the night — vast, white, and glittering against the Nairobi skyline. From the gated entrance, its marble pillars reflected the soft glow of garden lights. Every corner whispered luxury — the kind money couldn’t hide, and humility couldn’t touch.
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of rosemary, wine, and something sharper — pride.
It was dinner time. And dinner in the Skeem household wasn’t just a meal. It was a ritual of hierarchy, power, and unspoken judgment.

At the long glass table, Regina Skeem sat at the head — poised, silent, commanding. Her calm face betrayed nothing, but her eyes saw everything. Beside her, Amel Skeem scrolled through business reports on his tablet, barely looking up.
Raim Skeem sat across from his mother, a quiet strength in his posture, while Damon swirled red wine in his glass, his smirk never quite leaving his lips.
At the far end, Ginette flicked through her phone, pretending not to listen but catching every word.
The soft sound of jazz played in the background, echoing through the chandelier-lit dining hall.
“The board meeting went well,” Amel said finally, setting his tablet aside. “Some strong ideas were raised.”
Regina lifted her eyes. “Yes, I heard. Apparently, one came from the new girl?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon chuckled. “Oh, it was more than an idea. She made the whole board sit up.”
Raim added quietly, “She spoke with insight. Not just charm. She actually understands people — something our marketing team has been missing.”
“Her name?” Regina asked, though she already knew.
“Ida Mbona,” Amel replied. “A new assistant. Hired just this week.”
Regina’s fork paused mid-air. “Mbona?” she repeated slowly. “That doesn’t sound… familiar.”
Damon leaned back, amused. “That’s because she’s not from our circles, Mother. She’s from Kawangware.”
Ginette finally looked up. “The slum?”
The word cut through the air like a knife.
Raim’s jaw tightened. “Let’s not call it that. She’s hardworking, intelligent. Her background shouldn’t define her.”
Damon smirked. “Still, it’s a hell of a jump — from a stall in the ghetto to the Skeem boardroom.”
Regina’s eyes narrowed slightly. “And what exactly made her so memorable?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Raim met her gaze. “She challenged us — with respect. She saw the mall not as a business, but as a heartbeat. She was right.”
Amel nodded in agreement. “Her observations could drive real profit if executed correctly.”
Regina’s voice softened, but there was steel beneath. “Perhaps. But let’s not confuse boldness with brilliance. The higher you rise, the harder you fall.”
Her tone silenced the table.
Damon broke the tension with a slow sip of wine. “Or maybe, Mother, you just don’t like being impressed by the unexpected.”
“I don’t like surprises,” Regina replied coldly. “They usually come with hidden motives.”
The room fell quiet again, save for the faint crackle of the fireplace.
