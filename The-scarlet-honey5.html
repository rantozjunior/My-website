         “Wait… I got the job?”
“Yes, ma’am. Congratulations.”
The line went quiet after the call ended — and then, like thunder, her scream filled the house.
“I GOT IT!” she shouted, spinning in place. “I GOT THE JOB!”
Ephy screamed too, jumping up and down.
“You’re serious? You’re serious?! You’re going to work at Skeem Mall!”
Ethan stood, grinning wide.
“Ah! Our sister is now an office lady! Let’s start calling her Madam Ida!”
Nalani smiled, tears welling in her eyes. She set down her serving spoon and reached out to hold her daughter’s hands.
“You see, my child? God’s timing is perfect.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The family hugged tightly — laughing, crying, shouting — neighbors could probably hear them, but they didn’t care. For once, the world had opened its doors to one of their own.
That night, the small house glowed brighter than the city lights outside.
Nalani made sure there was more food than usual — a little meat, some extra chai, and even a few mandazis Ephy had saved from the stall. They ate and laughed under the dim bulb that flickered above them.
Ethan raised his cup of chai like a toast.
“To Ida Mbona — our very own miracle!”
“To Ida!” they all echoed, laughter bubbling through the air.
Ida looked around at their faces — her family, her reason. She couldn’t hold back the tears that stung her eyes.
“I’ll make you proud,” she whispered. “I promise.”
Nalani reached across the table, her voice soft but firm.
“You already have, my daughter.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The next morning came too fast. Ida was awake before dawn, ironing her only white blouse and polishing her shoes until they almost shone. The air outside was cool and fresh; she could hear matatus honking in the distance.
Ephy peeked from the door, rubbing her eyes.
“You look so smart, Ida. Like someone from TV.”
“It’s just work, Ephy,” Ida smiled, adjusting her skirt.
“Yeah, work that might make you famous.”
Ethan came in, still half-asleep, carrying a paper bag.
“Here, I got you this.”
Inside was a cheap pen and a notebook.
“For writing big boss things,” he said with a grin.
Ida laughed and hugged him tightly.
“Thank you, Ethan.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
When she stepped out, Nalani followed her to the gate.
“Remember, my daughter,” she said softly, “The world out there can be cruel. Smile, but don’t trust too easily.”
“I’ll be careful, Mama.”
Nalani kissed her forehead.
“Go and shine.”
By 7:50 a.m., Ida stood outside The Skeem Mall again.
This time, she walked in with her head a little higher. Her steps echoed on the marble floor, and when the receptionist saw her, there was a hint of respect in her tone.
“Good morning, Miss Mbona. You can go to the third floor. HR is expecting you.”
