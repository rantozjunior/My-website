        <p>
         The butler appeared at the doorway. “Madam Harriet Maverick is here.”
Regina’s lips curved. “Perfect timing.”
Harriet entered, dressed in a black velvet gown that shimmered with every step. Her confidence filled the room instantly. She greeted everyone warmly — perhaps too warmly — and took the seat beside Damon.
“I hope I’m not late,” she said sweetly.
“You’re just in time,” Damon said, smiling sideways.
Regina gestured to the butler. “Serve her.”
As plates of grilled salmon and buttered vegetables were placed before them, Harriet turned to Amel.
“I must say, the new assistant is quite the talk of the day.”
“She earned her place,” Amel replied..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Harriet’s eyes glinted. “Oh, I’m sure. I just wonder… how long she’ll keep it.”
Raim’s voice was quiet, but firm. “You sound threatened, Harriet.”
She laughed softly. “Me? Oh, no. I’m simply realistic. The Skeem world doesn’t tolerate mistakes — especially from outsiders.”
Damon’s grin widened. “You say that like you weren’t once an outsider yourself.”
Her eyes flicked to him sharply, but she didn’t reply.
Regina’s gaze moved from Harriet to Raim — then to Damon. She could feel something unspoken forming between them all, something that could either lift or ruin the Skeem name.
“Enough talk of staff,” she said finally. “We’ll judge her by her work.”
But the faintest crease at the corner of her mouth betrayed her curiosity.

Later that night, as the family dispersed — Ginette back to her phone, Amel to his study, Damon to his glass of whiskey — Regina stood by the window, looking out over the sprawling gardens.
Raim approached quietly. “You don’t trust her.”
Regina didn’t turn. “I don’t trust anyone who walks in from nowhere and earns your father’s praise in a day.”
“She’s talented, Mother.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“So was Harriet, once,” she said softly.
Raim frowned. “This isn’t about Harriet.”
Regina finally looked at him. “Everything in this house connects, Raim. Never forget that.”

Harriet’s driver opened the door as she slid into her car. Her perfect smile vanished the moment the door shut.
She pulled out her phone, dialing quickly.
“Yes. Find out everything you can about her. Ida Mbona. Where she lives, who she knows, what she wants.”
There was a pause.
“I don’t care how — just make sure she remembers her place.”
She hung up and looked out the window, her reflection sharp against the glass.
“Nobody walks into my world and steals my spotlight.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Miles away, in the hum of the ghetto night, Ida sat by her small window, her notebook open. The sounds of laughter and matatus filled the air outside, but inside her room — there was peace.
She was sketching ideas, writing notes for her proposal, each word carrying the weight of her dream.
Nalani peeked in. “You’re still awake?”
“Almost done, Mama. Just one more page.”
Nalani smiled faintly. “Don’t work yourself too hard. Remember to rest.”
“I will,” Ida said softly.
But when her mother left, Ida’s eyes went back to the paper.
She wrote the last line carefully:
‘People don’t just visit places — they remember how those places made them feel.’
She leaned back, smiling. Outside, the city lights flickered like a promise.
Little did she know, far across town, someone was already plotting to erase her name.
