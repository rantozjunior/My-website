         The words glowed red across Harriet Maverick’s screen:
ACCESS BREACH DETECTED. USER: IDA MBONA.
Her reflection in the darkened glass monitor flickered—half shadow, half satisfaction. She leaned back in her velvet chair, the city lights of Runda glimmering behind her like a constellation of secrets. The trap had sprung.
Harriet picked up her phone, her voice calm but urgent.
“Forward the report to Regina Skeem’s office. Make it look official. Include timestamp and access logs. No traces.”
“Yes, ma’am,” her assistant replied.
“Good,” she murmured. “Let’s see how fast the Skeems move when the fox looks like the lamb.”
At Skeem Mall, alarms didn’t blare—but the tension was electric. The IT department had flagged the alert within an hour. By morning, the words were everywhere:
“Unauthorized breach from user account: Ida Mbona.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Raim arrived early, his jaw tight. Damon stood by the glass window overlooking Nairobi, arms crossed, watching the slow spiral of rain over the skyline.
“She’s saying it wasn’t her,” Damon said quietly.
Raim didn’t answer. His eyes were distant, heavy with conflict. “She’s not capable of this.”
“And yet her name’s on every report,” Damon said, turning. “You realize what that looks like to Mother.”
“I don’t care what it looks like,” Raim replied. “I care what’s true.”
Regina entered then, her poise impeccable, flanked by Harriet Maverick, who held a neat folder pressed to her chest like a weapon disguised as paperwork.
“Raim,” Regina said smoothly. “We’ve concluded our investigation. The breach originated from Miss Mbona’s credentials. Company data was accessed, including the upcoming ‘Skeem Experience’ financials.”
Raim’s head snapped up. “That’s impossible.”
Harriet sighed softly, her voice dripping with concern. “I wish it weren’t, but the logs are undeniable. It appears… she may have copied some files. Possibly under pressure or persuasion. Poor thing.”
Her tone was sympathetic. Her eyes were not..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Regina’s gaze lingered on her son. “You were the one who vouched for her, Raim. I hope you’re not letting personal attachment cloud your judgment.”
Raim’s silence was answer enough.
By noon, Ida was called in again. Her palms were clammy, her heart pounding as she stepped into the same boardroom that had once felt like triumph. Now it felt like trial.
Harriet sat beside Regina, expression calm, pen poised over her notes.
Amel Skeem watched from the head of the table, tired but stern. “Miss Mbona,” he said, “we have serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to classified data. Do you have anything to say?”
Ida swallowed hard. “Sir, I didn’t do this. Someone used my account. Please, believe me.”
“Then how do you explain these logs?” Regina asked, sliding a file toward her.
Ida looked down. There it was again—her name, her ID, her time stamps. Every click, every action. Too perfect. Too clean.
“I… I don’t know,” she whispered..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Convenient,” Harriet said gently. “Perhaps someone else used your computer? A colleague maybe?”
The suggestion landed softly, like a whisper, but it was a blade.
Raim’s brow furrowed. “What are you implying?”
Harriet turned her head slightly. “Only that one of the junior IT staff, Mark Onyango, has been seen around her desk frequently. Perhaps he helped her without realizing it.”
Amel frowned. “Mark Onyango?”
“Yes,” Harriet said, feigning hesitation. “He once mentioned to me that Ida left her station unlocked one evening. It’s possible he had access.”
Raim’s eyes darkened. “You’re twisting this—”
