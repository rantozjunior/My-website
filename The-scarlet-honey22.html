         He met her eyes. “Maybe I have.”
Silence fell—quiet, electric. Outside, the city glittered like a secret.
“Ida,” he began, voice low. “These past months, you’ve changed more than the mall. You’ve changed me. I don’t know when it started, or how, but… I can’t ignore it anymore.”
Her breath caught.
“I care about you,” he said simply. “More than I should.”
For a heartbeat, she couldn’t move. The world outside seemed to pause with her.
“Raim…” she whispered, her voice trembling. “You don’t have to—”
“I do,” he said softly. “Because it’s true.”
Her eyes glistened, caught between disbelief and emotion. “I never expected this.”
“Neither did I,” he said, smiling faintly. “But I’m glad it found me.”
They stood in that quiet moment, not as boss and employee, but as two people who had weathered storms together—and somehow, found light.

He had come to tell Raim something trivial about a board meeting, but what he saw instead stilled him—Ida’s quiet smile, Raim’s unguarded gaze.
He turned away, shoving his hands into his pockets.
It wasn’t jealousy at first. It was curiosity. Then, slowly, something deeper began to stir—something he hadn’t felt in years.
He remembered her first day—the courage, the honesty, the spark in her eyes when she’d faced their mother in the boardroom.
He laughed under his breath, shaking his head. “Careful, Damon,” he muttered. “You’re falling for a storm you can’t control.”
But the thought didn’t leave him.

That night, as the Skeem mansion lights dimmed, Regina watched her sons from the balcony—Raim calm as ever, Damon restless as thunder. She could sense change coming, like pressure before rain.
And far across the city, in a small room in Kawangware, Nalani Mbona prayed softly for her daughter—unaware that love and danger were now walking the same path toward her child.
The city outside hummed with life. The Skeem Mall shone like glass under moonlight—beautiful, fragile, and full of secrets yet to unfold.
