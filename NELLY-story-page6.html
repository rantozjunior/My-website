    <h2>Chapter 3: Into The Depths </br>(continued)</h2>
    <p1>They pressed further, deeper into the station. Rusted gates, abandoned vending machines, and broken columns provided cover as they ran. Shadows twisted in the corners of their vision, the creatures relentless.
Finally, they reached a small chamber off the main tunnel. It was a maintenance room, partially intact. They barricaded the door with debris and collapsed against the walls, panting heavily.
Heida sank to the floor, trembling. “I… I can’t believe we’re still alive.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Beldarmore knelt beside her, brushing dirt from her face. “You’re alive. And that’s what matters. Right now, we breathe. Then we plan.”
Chiesniey leaned against the wall, rifle resting across her knees. “We can’t stay here long. They’ll find us eventually. But for a moment… we have a chance to catch our breath.”
The violet light shimmered briefly at the doorway. Xekara’s eyes seemed to meet Beldarmore’s, almost deliberately. There was no smile, no emotion he could read—but something lingered, a subtle acknowledgment, a warning, a promise.
Beldarmore’s pulse quickened. He didn’t understand it, but he knew this encounter had changed something.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Heida’s voice broke through his thoughts. “Beldar… do you think we’ll make it?”
He brushed a strand of hair from her face. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “But I know we’ll try. Together.”
Chiesniey glanced at him sharply. “Focus. We survive first, feelings later.”
Beldarmore allowed himself a faint, wry smile. “Feelings are a part of survival, believe me. Just… keep your eyes open.”
The hum in his mind returned. [Objective: Survive – Learn]
Outside the maintenance room, the faint echoes of claws scraping against concrete reminded him that the nightmare wasn’t over. The rift still pulsed above the city, a wound in the sky that promised more terror, more chaos, and more impossible creatures.
Heida shivered beside him. “I don’t want to die,” she whispered.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“You won’t,” Beldarmore said softly, gripping her hand briefly. “Not if I can help it. Not today. Not ever.”
The violet glow flickered again in the shadows. Somewhere beyond, Xekara watched. And for the first time, Beldarmore felt something like determination flare inside him—not just to survive, but to fight.
The city above was broken. The tunnels were dark and full of monsters. But in that moment, in the small maintenance room, they were alive.
And alive was enough.
