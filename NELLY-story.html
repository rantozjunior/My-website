    <h2>Chapter 1: The Day The Sky Broke</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Beldarmore Valgra had never considered the city beautiful. Velhaven was a patchwork of gray concrete and neon signs, cracked sidewalks, and streets that smelled faintly of gasoline and fried food. But that morning, even the dreariest streets seemed alive—though not in any good way.
The first sign had been subtle: a low vibration under his boots as he walked toward the corner vending machine. He had been muttering to himself about needing coffee and a proper breakfast, and the machine, as if understanding his complaint, had refused to cooperate. Beldarmore had given it a swift kick, causing it to cough up a single bottle of water.
“Victory,” he whispered, picking up the bottle and twisting the cap. “A small one, but mine.”
“Beldar, why do you talk to machines like they’re people?” Heida Skeem’s voice called from behind him, sharp but weary. She was fastidious, always dressed neatly despite the morning chaos, and had that look in her eyes that said she wanted to fix the world but hadn’t yet figured out how.
“I find them more reliable than humans,” Beldarmore replied with a grin. “They don’t lie, cheat, or disappoint… well, except this one.” He pointed at the vending machine. “But it learned its lesson.”
Heida rolled her eyes, tugging at the sleeve of her jacket. “We’re going to be late for the briefing, you know.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Briefing? Please. They can wait. I have a destiny to fulfill here,” Beldarmore said dramatically, taking a sip of water and wincing at the cool sweetness.
Before she could retort, a strange hum rolled through the air. It started deep and low, like the vibration of some enormous bell buried beneath the city. Beldarmore froze mid-step, head tilting upward.
“Do you hear that?” Heida’s voice was sharp, tense. She wasn’t the type to panic easily.
“I hear it,” he said quietly. “And I don’t like it.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The hum rose in pitch, vibrating through his chest, making his teeth ache. People on the street stopped. Phones were lifted instinctively as if to record the impossible, but nobody spoke. The city seemed to hold its breath.
And then the sky tore.It was a line at first, thin and glowing blue, splitting clouds as if someone had drawn a knife across the heavens. Then another line. Then another. The crack widened rapidly, jagged and pulsing with an unnatural light. It wasn’t clouds moving. It wasn’t sunlight. It was something entirely new, a wound in the fabric of the sky.
Beldarmore felt a shiver run down his spine. “That… is not normal.”
Heida gasped. “Is it… a storm?”
“No,” he said, stepping closer to her, instinctively shielding her with his body. “Storms don’t scream.”
The sound came then. A pure, almost musical scream that carried across the city, vibrating against glass, concrete, and bone. People screamed, ran, fell. Some stared upward in disbelief, unable to move.
And then the first figure fell..<br>.<br>.
<br>
It hit the street with a heavy crash, sending shards of asphalt into the air. Beldarmore instinctively dove forward, dragging Heida behind a half-collapsed bench. The figure rose almost immediately, though. Too tall, too thin, with limbs bending at impossible angles. Its skin was black and reflective, like polished stone, and its eyes—if they could be called that—glowed faintly red in hollow sockets.
Beldarmore swallowed hard. “Okay. That’s… definitely not normal.”
The creature growled, a low, guttural sound that rattled his teeth. It moved with a terrifying speed, sweeping a claw across a nearby car that exploded into twisted metal.
“Run!” Heida screamed, gripping his arm.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>   
Before they could, another figure landed on the street. Unlike the first, this one moved with grace. She touched down lightly, barely disturbing the cracked asphalt. Her hair, long and black as midnight, floated around her shoulders, moving like it had a life of its own. Her skin was pale with faint silver veins, and her violet eyes seemed to pierce everything they fell upon.
Beldarmore’s breath caught. She was impossibly beautiful, impossibly alien, and entirely terrifying.
“You shouldn’t be here,” she said softly, voice calm and clear, carrying across the chaos.
The shadow-creature hissed and lunged. Without a sound, she moved. A shimmer of black energy wrapped around the creature, freezing it mid-motion before shattering it into dust.
Beldarmore blinked, unsure whether to be awed or terrified.
