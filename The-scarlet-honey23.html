         The morning sun spilled gently over Kawangware, painting the rusted rooftops gold one last time.
Inside the Mbona house, laughter bubbled through the walls — laughter that had been missing for far too long.
“Mama, stop guessing,” Ida said, smiling as she covered her mother’s eyes. “You’ll see soon enough.”
Nalani chuckled. “You’re making me nervous, my child. What is this surprise?”
“Just trust me,” Ida said.
Ephy was already dressed in her best outfit, excitement written all over her face. “If it’s food, I already love it!”
Ethan, leaning on the doorframe, grinned. “No, this one’s different. I saw the papers in her bag. Lease agreements.”
Nalani froze. “Lease?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Ida dropped her hands from her mother’s eyes and smiled softly. “We’re moving, Mama. To Westlands.”
For a heartbeat, the room went silent — until Ephy squealed so loud the neighbors probably heard.
“Westlands?! Like the one with the big buildings and supermarkets that stay open all night?!”
Nalani blinked, unsure whether to laugh or cry. “My daughter, what are you saying?”
“I’ve already paid the deposit,” Ida said. “A three-bedroom apartment. Running water, balcony, kitchen big enough for all of us. You won’t have to wake up before sunrise to fetch anything anymore.”
Nalani covered her mouth, tears welling in her eyes. “God above…”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Ethan pulled Ida into a hug, his voice thick. “You did it, sis. You really did it.”
That afternoon, they packed what little they owned. The matatu ride to Westlands felt unreal — the chaos of Kawangware fading behind them, replaced by wide roads, leafy lanes, and a quiet Ida had only dreamed about.
When they arrived, Ephy ran through every room, shouting, “This one’s mine!”
Nalani stood in the living room, touching the clean white walls as though they might disappear.
“This,” she whispered, “is peace.”
Ida looked out the balcony at the city skyline — the same skyline she’d once watched from a matatu window, dreaming. Now, it was hers to touch.
Back at Skeem Mall, life was equally golden — at least on the surface.
The Skeem Experience was a citywide success. Crowds poured in day and night, investors lined up for expansions, and the board was thrilled. But beneath the surface, the balance was shifting.
Raim was quieter these days. Focused, kind — but distracted..<br>.<br>.
<br>
He found himself pausing too long outside Ida’s office, pretending to discuss reports that didn’t really need discussing.
She noticed, though she pretended not to.
Damon noticed too.
One late evening, as Ida left the building, she found Damon leaning casually against the marble wall near the elevators.
“You work too much,” he said.
She smiled. “You sound like your brother.”
“Maybe. But unlike him, I actually mean it.”
She laughed softly. “You both care in your own way.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
He studied her quietly. “You ever think about what you’ve done, Ida? How far you’ve come? Most people would’ve broken. You built yourself instead.”
“I didn’t do it alone,” she said. “People believed in me.”
“Raim,” he said, his voice softer now. “You mean Raim.”
She hesitated, meeting his gaze. “Yes… and others too.”
Damon smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Just be careful, Ida. This world — our world — doesn’t always reward kindness.”
He turned and walked away before she could reply.
For the first time, she saw something vulnerable behind his easy grin — something real.
