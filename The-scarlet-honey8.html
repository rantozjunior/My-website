            She looked at the chart again, noticing that the drop in numbers happened mostly in the evenings — right after working hours. People weren’t staying to shop. They were rushing home.
An idea began to form. A risky one.
When the room fell silent, Amel turned to her suddenly.
“You’ve been quiet, Miss Mbona. Anything to add?”
Every head turned. Harriet smirked.
“Oh, this should be good.”
Ida took a deep breath, her hands trembling slightly.
“I… I noticed something, sir. If I may.”
Amel nodded. “Go on.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Ida stood up slowly and pointed at the slide.
“The issue isn’t the number of visitors during the day — it’s retention. The mall looks great, but it feels cold. There’s no warmth. No reason for people to stay longer after work. Nairobians don’t just want to shop — they want comfort, connection, and atmosphere.”
She spoke faster now, her confidence growing.
“If we created evening experiences — live art, street-food corners, music — we’d give them something to look forward to. Not just a mall, but a lifestyle. People should feel like Skeem Mall understands them — not just their wallets.”
The room went quiet..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon blinked. “That… actually makes sense.”
Raim leaned forward, clearly impressed. “You’re saying we turn it into an experience, not just a shopping space.”
“Exactly,” Ida said, her eyes lighting up. “Make it the place where Nairobi ends its day, not just runs errands.”
Harriet laughed softly.
“Cute speech. But she’s an assistant, not a strategist.”
“Ideas don’t care about titles,” Raim replied sharply. “And that was brilliant.”
Harriet’s smile faltered. Damon shot her a knowing smirk.
Amel cleared his throat.
“Miss Mbona, I’d like you to put that in writing. A short proposal. Tomorrow.”
Ida nodded, trying not to let her voice shake.
“Yes, sir. Thank you.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
When the board finally adjourned, people began filing out. Harriet walked past Ida slowly, her perfume lingering — sweet, but poisonous.
“Enjoy your little moment,” she whispered. “They always fade.”
Before Ida could reply, Harriet was gone, heels clicking like knives on the marble floor.
Damon lingered by the door, smirking.
“You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. I like it.”
“Thank you, sir— I mean, Damon,” she stammered.
“Careful,” he said, eyes gleaming. “This place eats the brave first.”
Then he left.
Raim, however, stayed a moment longer.
“You were impressive,” he said quietly. “Don’t let anyone make you small. Not here.”
