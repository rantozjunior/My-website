    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 10  </h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5: The Hillsville </br> (continued)</h2>
    <p1>Beldarmore shot him a tired look. “Do you ever stop?”
“Nope,” Damon replied cheerfully. “Annoying people keeps me alive.”
Xekara walked into the center of the clearing. “You will all learn the basics today. Shelter. Tools. Fire. Food.” Her eyes lingered on Beldarmore longer than necessary. “And leadership.”
Beldarmore frowned. “I didn’t volunteer.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“No,” Xekara said. “But they look to you anyway.”
He glanced around. Heida nodded shyly. Chiesniey gave him a small smile. Even Antonia looked relieved when his eyes met hers. Damon looked annoyed.
Damon stepped forward, smirking. “Oh, so he’s the chosen one? What a shock.”
Beldarmore met his gaze steadily. “It’s not a title. It’s survival.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Sure,” Damon said. “But don’t get ahead of yourself, hero. Not all of us like following orders.”
Heida tensed. “Damon, please—”
But Beldarmore raised a hand gently, stopping her. He stepped toward Damon slowly, his voice calm, grounded.
“Damon… the world we knew ended weeks ago,” he said. “Everything—your house, your job, your neighborhood—gone. We’re living on bonus time. And the only way we stay alive is together.”
Damon’s smirk softened, just barely..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Beldarmore continued, “You don’t have to like me. You don’t have to follow me. But if you want to survive—really survive—put that ego aside and adapt.”
For a moment, Damon said nothing. The forest wind rustled the branches. The waterfall murmured quietly.
Then Damon exhaled a slow breath and said, “You talk too much.”
But his eyes were no longer sharp with hostility. Just conflicted.
Chiesniey whispered behind Beldarmore, “That was… surprisingly wise.”
Beldarmore shrugged. “He’s not a bad guy. Just stubborn.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Heida’s lips curled into a small, warm smile. “Still… you handled him well. Really well.”
As she spoke, Xekara walked close, her voice low enough that only Beldarmore heard it.
“You speak like someone who has carried responsibility before,” she murmured. “Interesting.”
Her tone wasn’t mocking. It was… curious. Almost soft.
Beldarmore blinked. “I’m just trying to keep everyone alive.”
Xekara’s eyes lingered on him for a moment, a faint warmth there before she looked away sharply.

Training began immediately.
Chiesniey taught the survivors how to break fallen branches, sharpen stones, and tie simple bindings using vines.
Xekara supervised silently at first, then stepped in, correcting their stances with brief touches or sharp commands.
“Wider footing, Beldarmore. Too much weight on your right side.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“No, Heida. Grip the stone tighter. It won’t hurt you unless you let it slip.”
“Antonia, bend your knees. Like that.
Heida kept stealing quick glances at Beldarmore when she thought he wasn’t looking. He caught her twice. Both times, she flushed and pretended to focus on her work.
Damon noticed too. He smirked. “Looks like you’ve got an admirer.”
Heida choked on air. “W–what? Damon!”
