         The morning sunlight poured through the blinds of the HR office at Skeem Mall, bathing Ida’s desk in gold. She had barely slept, her mind still spinning from the board meeting and the words that had replayed all night — “Put that in writing.”
So she had.
Her notebook lay open beside her laptop, every page filled with sketches, words, and small drawings of what she imagined the mall could become — a place that lived after sunset. She titled it simply:
“The Skeem Experience: A 24-Hour Nairobi Hub.”
Her hands trembled as she printed the final version, placed it in a neat folder, and walked toward the conference office.
Each step echoed like a heartbeat.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Raim was already there, leaning against the window with a cup of coffee. Damon sat sprawled on a chair, scrolling through his phone, and Amel stood near the head of the table, reading the morning paper.
When Ida walked in, Raim straightened immediately. “Miss Mbona. You’re early.”
“I wanted to make sure everything was ready, sir— I mean, Raim,” she said, smiling shyly.
Damon chuckled. “Someone’s nervous. Don’t worry, we only eat ideas. Not people.”
She smiled politely but said nothing.
Amel looked up. “Let’s begin.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Ida nodded and opened her folder. Her voice was calm, steady — but her eyes were alive.
“Skeem Mall isn’t just a building,” she began. “It’s a heartbeat in the middle of the city. But after eight p.m., that heartbeat stops. We need to keep it alive.”
She clicked to the first slide — bright, colorful designs showing cafes that stayed open at night, music corners, late-night bookshops, rooftop movie nights, and coworking spaces for young professionals.
“Nairobi doesn’t sleep. People work late, travel late, dream late. So why should their mall close early?”
The board watched in silence. Damon leaned forward, clearly impressed. Raim smiled faintly, arms crossed, proud.
She continued.
“The Skeem Experience will redefine nightlife — not with chaos, but with comfort. A 24-hour safe, secure, and social environment. A living, breathing mall.”
She finished, breathless, heart pounding. “That’s… that’s my proposal.”
The silence lasted only a second before Amel began to clap slowly. Then Raim joined in. Even Damon tapped the table, grinning.
“Brilliant,” Amel said, standing. “Truly visionary.”
“I told you she was special,” Raim added..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Well, well,” Damon smirked. “Guess we’ve found our star.”
Ida felt her cheeks flush. “Thank you. I’m honored.”
Regina wasn’t in the room, but her shadow felt heavy in the silence that followed. They all knew she’d hear about this soon — and she wouldn’t be thrilled.
After the meeting, as the others left, Raim lingered near the window. Ida began gathering her files when his voice stopped her.
“You should celebrate,” he said softly.
She turned. “Celebrate?”
“You just gave this family one of its biggest breakthroughs in years. You deserve at least a good meal.”
