    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 3</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2: Under The Broken Sky</h2>
    <p1>Beldarmore Valgra crouched behind the ruins of a collapsed storefront, breathing hard. The street before him was a disaster zone: chunks of asphalt twisted like molten metal, broken power lines sparkled with live electricity, and the buildings leaned precariously as if they might topple at any moment.
Heida Skeem pressed herself against his side, trembling, her hands gripping the straps of her small backpack like a lifeline. “Beldar… what do we do now?” she whispered, her voice almost drowned by the distant, echoing roars from the rift above.
“First,” Beldarmore said, keeping his voice low but steady, “we stay alive. Then… we figure out everything else.”
Heida shivered. “Everything else?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Exactly,” he said with a faint smirk, though he felt no humor in it. “Right now, the city is trying to kill us. Literally. Focus on surviving. Everything else comes second.”
Chiesniey Marga crouched a few meters ahead, rifle ready, eyes scanning the ruins. Her presence was a steadying force. Even amid the chaos, she moved with practiced efficiency, her body calm, trained, and poised for action. She caught Beldarmore’s glance and nodded.
“We’ll need shelter,” she said softly. “There’s a subway entrance two blocks east. It should be structurally sound. If we can reach it, we can regroup.”
Beldarmore glanced at the shattered street, estimating the distance. “Two blocks of death, monsters, and collapsing buildings?” His grin was tight, forced. “Yeah… we’ll manage.”
Heida’s hands shook as she clutched his arm. “We can’t just run into the open!”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“We won’t,” Beldarmore said. “We’ll use cover. Move quickly. Stay close. And don’t stop unless I say so.”
A low, guttural growl echoed from the ruins across the street. Heida froze. Chiesniey adjusted her grip on the rifle. Beldarmore leaned forward, eyes scanning the shadows. From the rift above, a monstrous figure emerged, sleek, black, with limbs bending at unnatural angles and claws that scraped the asphalt as it moved. Its glowing red eyes locked on them.
Beldarmore felt a familiar tingle in his mind. The system.
[Survival Protocol Active]
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
His heart skipped a beat, not in fear, but in clarity. Instinct sharpened. Every sense heightened.
Heida whimpered. “Beldar… I don’t think we can—”
“Yes, we can,” Beldarmore interrupted firmly, taking her hand and squeezing it. “We’ve survived worse. Just… trust me.”
Chiesniey moved first, darting across a pile of rubble, rifle aimed ahead. Beldarmore followed immediately, dragging Heida with him. Sparks showered from broken wires overhead, the acrid smell of smoke filling their lungs. The monster hissed, advancing with horrifying speed.
Suddenly, a shadow flickered at the far end of the street. Xekara.
She stepped from the edge of a ruined alley, her presence impossible to ignore. The violet glow in her eyes cut through the haze, and her hair floated around her like living smoke. She raised one hand, and a ripple of energy shot forward, striking the monster. The creature convulsed, snarling, before collapsing into a smoking heap of shattered limbs.
Beldarmore blinked. “She saved us… again.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Chiesniey exhaled sharply. “We can’t rely on her. Keep moving.”
They sprinted toward the subway entrance Chiesniey had indicated. Rubble crunched under their feet. Broken glass glittered like cruel confetti. Beldarmore’s mind worked frantically, noting every obstacle, every shadow that might hide a predator.
Halfway there, Heida stumbled, nearly falling. Beldarmore grabbed her, pulling her upright. “Focus, Heida. Eyes forward. One step at a time.”
Her grip on his arm tightened. “I… I can’t believe I’m still alive,” she admitted, her voice trembling.
“You are alive,” Beldarmore said softly. “And we’re not done yet.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Chiesniey paused, checking the street behind them. “We have to move fast. There’s more coming.”
The hum of the rift grew louder. Dust and debris swirled violently as if the city itself were exhaling. Beldarmore glanced at Xekara, who now stood atop a pile of rubble, scanning the horizon with those impossible violet eyes. There was no expression on her face, but the energy radiating from her made him certain of one thing: she could kill everything around them without hesitation.
Beldarmore’s pulse quickened. He didn’t know whether to feel relief or fear at the thought of relying on her.
“Almost there,” Chiesniey called, pointing toward a stairwell that led underground. The subway entrance was partially intact, dust and rubble blocking part of it, but it was their best chance at safety.
