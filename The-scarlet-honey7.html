         By evening, Ida was exhausted but happy. Her first day had gone better than she could’ve imagined — she’d met everyone, learned the basics, even managed to organize the files in her small department before lunch.
At 5:42 p.m., just as she was about to shut down her computer, her phone buzzed with an internal message.
“Report to Conference Room A. Immediately. – Management.”
Her heart skipped..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Conference Room A? That was the big one. The boardroom.
She swallowed hard, looking around. The other assistants were leaving, grabbing their handbags and laughing softly. None of them had received such a message.
“Um… sorry,” she asked one of them, “is there another Conference Room A?”
The lady gave her a look — half amused, half pitying.
“No, sweetheart. That’s where the board meets. You sure they meant you?”
Ida hesitated, staring at the message again. Her name was there. Clear as day.
“Yes,” she whispered, “I’m sure.”
She straightened her blouse, smoothed her skirt, and took a deep breath. Then she walked toward the elevator, her heart pounding so hard she could hear it.
The moment she stepped in, Ida felt the air change..<br>.<br>.
<br>
The room was large, glass-walled, and cold — filled with the scent of expensive perfume and power.
Around the polished mahogany table sat the entire Skeem board: Amel Skeem, dignified and sharp-eyed; Regina Skeem, graceful but unreadable; Ginette Skeem, scrolling through her phone; and the two brothers — Raim calm and composed, Damon leaning back in his chair with his usual smirk.
And then, in a red dress that screamed danger, Harriet Maverick sat across from them, her long legs crossed elegantly.
Ida froze at the door.
“Ah,” Amel said without looking up, “you must be the new assistant.”
“Y-yes, sir,” Ida replied softly.
“Come in. Sit there,” he said, gesturing to an empty chair near the end of the table.
Her palms were sweating. She hadn’t prepared for this. What was she even doing here?
A man from marketing was halfway through a dull slideshow about Skeem Mall’s declining foot traffic. The board members looked unimpressed.
Harriet leaned forward, smiling sweetly..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“With all due respect,” she said, her voice smooth as silk, “your numbers are tragic. Perhaps the Skeems need someone with a better understanding of customer engagement.”
Damon rolled his eyes.
“We’ve heard your ideas before, Harriet. Another fashion show? A magazine spread? The mall isn’t a catwalk.”
“At least my ideas make headlines,” she snapped.
Raim intervened calmly.
“Let’s keep this professional.”
As they argued, Ida sat quietly, taking notes. But something inside her started ticking. She saw what others didn’t — the missing link in the presentation. The focus was all wrong.
