    <p1>Some of you will gain it. And Beldarmore Valgra,” her gaze sharpened, “you are at the center of it all.”
Heida shivered. “The center… of what?”
“The choice between survival and destruction,” Xekara said, her voice echoing slightly in the chamber. “Between those who will fight and those who will succumb. You are alive, here, now—for a reason. Learn quickly, or you will die.”
Beldarmore clenched his fists, feeling the surge of adrenaline and responsibility. “Then we learn. Together. And I promise…” His gaze swept over Chiesniey, Heida, and the other survivors. “No one dies while I’m here. Not tonight, not ever.”
Xekara’s eyes lingered on him, violet flames glowing softly. “Brave… stubborn. Potential, yes. But beware—bravery without understanding leads to death.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
A sudden tremor shook the tunnel. Dust fell from the ceiling. Something was coming—another wave of creatures, drawn by the chaos and the survivors’ fear.
Beldarmore stepped in front of Chiesniey and Heida instantly, body tense, muscles coiled to strike. “All right. Lesson one: stay alive. Lesson two: keep them safe. Lesson three… we fight.”
Heida grabbed his arm, squeezing tightly. “I… I’m ready, if you are.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Chiesniey’s eyes met his, rifle raised. “We survive. Together. No exceptions.”
Xekara’s violet glow pulsed faintly. “Then you will begin your first lesson. The world above will not wait for you to understand. It only knows hunger, chaos, and survival. Learn fast… or perish.”
Beldarmore exhaled sharply. His hands flexed, ready. His mind sharpened. For Chiesniey, for Heida, for the other survivors—and for himself—he would not fail.
Above them, the rift pulsed. The creatures stirred. The city was broken. But down here, in the darkness, the survivors had a chance. And Beldarmore Valgra was ready to defend that chance with everything he had.
