    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 12</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 6: Hillsville's New Dawn</h2>
    <p1>The morning fog rolled through Hillsville Forest like pale breath exhaled from the mountains, weaving between the towering pines as the survivors stirred to life. Beldarmore woke before the others, as he always did, sitting on the half-finished wooden frame of their shelter, sharpening the stone blade Xekara had carved for him.
Chiesniey was nearby, packing herbs. Heida was turning over firewood to dry. Damon sat on a fallen log, picking dirt from under his nails with a thin twig and wearing the most bored expression a man could wear and still be alive.
“Morning, fearless leader,” Damon drawled. “Sleep well? Dream of responsibilities again?”
Beldarmore didn’t look up. “Dreamed you’d wake up useful today. Didn’t happen.”
Heida tried not to laugh. Chiesniey failed entirely.
Damon placed a hand on his chest. “Wow. Straight to the heart. Do you ever worry your sarcasm will hurt my incredibly delicate feelings?”
“No,” Beldarmore said.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon smirked. “Good. Me neither.”
The banter broke as the sound of rustling approached from the eastern slope. Beldarmore stood instantly, stepping ahead of the others. Damon rose too, hands loose at his sides, ready.
Xekara emerged from the trees first, walking with silent grace, her silver eyes flicking back over her shoulder. Behind her came the new survivors—worn, hungry, exhausted, but alive.
Silas Dray stepped forward first, tall, scarred, expression unreadable. Corin Hale followed him, thin but steady. Milo Bannett darted past them, all quick energy and wide curiosity, nearly tripping on a root. Aria Thornwell moved silently like a shadow, eyes alert. Sophie Reddan clutched her arms to her chest, staring at the camp with cautious hope.
“They’re safe,” Xekara said softly. “We found them along the southern ridge.”
Beldarmore nodded. “Welcome to Hillsville. You’re safe here.”
Silas looked at him carefully. “You the one in charge?”
Damon lifted a hand. “Oh no, that would be him.” He pointed at Beldarmore dramatically. “Tall, serious, heroic jawline—total leadership material.”
Beldarmore exhaled slowly. “I lead because someone has to.”
Silas nodded once, accepting that..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Milo bounced on his heels. “This place is incredible! Fresh water, shelter, actual people—holy hell, is that a fire pit?”
Sophie smiled faintly, the first spark of warmth she’d shown. “It feels… peaceful.”
Aria’s eyes, calm but sharp, studied Beldarmore for a long moment. “We’re grateful.”
As they entered camp, Xekara lingered beside Beldarmore, her gaze brushing him like moonlight. Her voice lowered.
“Your presence gives them stability,” she said quietly. “Human groups follow strength. You carry it as if it belongs to you.”
“It doesn’t,” he said. “It’s just needed.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Xekara watched him longer than was necessary. Her unreadable expression shifted—something soft, faint, almost uncertain. Then she looked away, as if catching herself.
Chiesniey noticed. Heida noticed. Damon noticed most of all.
“Well,” Damon muttered, “this is going to get interesting.”
Later that Afternoon — Training Begins
The clearing echoed with the sound of footsteps, splintering wood, and frustrated groans as Xekara trained the newcomers. Her movements were fluid, almost ethereal, guiding each survivor with cool precision.
Silas blocked a strike and grunted. “You fight like you’re made of smoke.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Smoke does not bleed,” Xekara replied calmly, pushing him back with one smooth motion.
Milo attempted a roll and face-planted in the dirt.
“I’m good!” he yelled, muffled.
Aria mastered the footwork quickly, her focus sharp. Sophie struggled with the stance until Chiesniey helped adjust her shoulders, offering kind words.
Beldarmore oversaw everything, moving between them with quiet authority—correcting grips, demonstrating strikes, encouraging, commanding.
Heida watched him from the side, her gaze following every step he made. When he spoke to her, her cheeks warmed.
“You alright?” he asked.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Yeah,” she whispered. “Just… glad we have you.”
Her voice trembled slightly, surprising even her.
Beldarmore smiled gently. “We have each other.”
She looked down, hiding the small smile that betrayed her growing feelings.
