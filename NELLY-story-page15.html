    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 15</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 7: Blood And Burden</h2>
    <p1>The morning mist lingered among the trees of Hillsville like a living thing, curling around the massive pines and painting the forest floor in silver. Beldarmore tightened the straps of his makeshift harness, the weight of the rudimentary weapons pressing against his chest. Heida hovered nearby, adjusting the rope bindings around the blunt spear she’d carved herself, her eyes never leaving him.
“Are you always this meticulous?” Damon drawled from a fallen log, twirling a sharpened branch between his fingers. “Or is it just the apocalypse that brings out your heroic OCD?”
“I’m trying to keep everyone alive,” Beldarmore replied, his voice calm but firm. “You should try it sometime.”
Damon leaned back, smirking. “Ah, yes. Hero mode: activated. Makes me feel so safe. Maybe I’ll write a song about it later.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Heida shot Damon a glare, cheeks flushed, while Beldarmore ignored the quip, scanning the perimeter. Xekara emerged silently from the mist, her silver eyes focused and unreadable, though there was a subtle flicker in her gaze as it settled on him.
“Everyone knows their role,” Beldarmore said, finally turning toward the two women. “Heida, Damon’s your responsibility. You stick with him. Chiesniey stays here to protect the people. Silas and Sophie are with me. Xekara, we move together.”
Heida’s fingers brushed against his arm briefly, an accidental—or maybe deliberate—touch that sent warmth up his spine. He caught the glance Xekara gave him in return: curious, intense, something foreign yet undeniable. Both women wanted him, and for once he let it slip aside. Survival came first.
“Perfect,” Damon said, drawing a long, lazy breath. “So, I get to babysit Heida while you go smooch with your mysterious alien friend. Not jealous at all.”
“Shut up and move,” Beldarmore said, already leading the way.
.<br>.<br>.

Into the Ruins
The city was a skeletal monument to the world they had lost. Broken buildings jutted like jagged teeth, windows gaping open like empty eyes. The streets were littered with rubble and the occasional skeletal remains of vehicles, twisted and rusting. Every shadow seemed alive, every corner threatening.
Heida stayed close to Damon, whispering occasionally. “It feels… wrong being here. So empty, so silent.”
Damon tilted his head, grinning. “Welcome to the ghost town special. Don’t worry; I’ll protect you. Maybe. If I’m in the mood.”
“Damon,” Heida hissed, rolling her eyes..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Relax,” he said. “It’s called survival with style. And sarcasm.”
Beldarmore led silently beside Xekara, every muscle tense, eyes scanning for movement. Her steps were soundless, predatory. She leaned slightly toward him as they advanced through a broken alley.
“These creatures… they sense life differently than humans,” she murmured, her voice low. “You are strong. They notice it.”
He felt the subtle undercurrent in her words, the fascination and something more—alien emotions she could neither name nor understand. He let it go, focusing on the task ahead.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Finding the Weapons
The warehouse was half-collapsed, metal doors hanging at impossible angles. Dust rose like fog as they entered, the scent of rust and decay thick in the air. Crates of guns, grenades, and military gear lined the walls.
Milo practically bounced in place. “Holy—actual weapons! We can finally fight back!”
Silas moved methodically, checking each crate. “Take only what you can carry. We move fast or we die.”
Sophie’s hands trembled as she picked up a rifle, the weight unfamiliar. She turned toward Beldarmore. “Do you think we’ll survive?”
He knelt beside her, keeping his voice calm. “We will. Stick to the plan, watch each other, and don’t take unnecessary risks.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon leaned against a beam, flipping a small knife in his hand. “Plan, survival, heroics… you’re really killing the suspense here, boss man.”
Heida rolled her eyes but stayed near, glancing at Beldarmore with an expression that spoke louder than words. Xekara, standing silently at his side, met his gaze briefly. Her eyes held concern, fascination, something dangerous.
A low, guttural growl echoed through the building. Shadows moved across the walls.
Beldarmore’s head snapped up. “They know we’re here! Move!”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
From the broken windows, shapes lunged—twisted creatures, claws long and jagged, faces frozen in permanent snarl. Beldarmore swung a metal pipe, knocking one aside. Xekara moved like liquid, striking with deadly precision.
Damon grinned as he ducked a swipe and plunged his knife into a creature’s neck. “My, oh my, how heroic I feel. Someone write this down!”
Heida crouched behind him, thrusting her spear forward. “Beldarmore, over here!”
