         Stop playing with fire, Harriet. —D
Her smile froze.

That night, Raim sat alone in his office, lights dim, scrolling through transaction records. Something didn’t add up—the transfer happened from a secondary admin account that Ida didn’t even have access to. He leaned back, rubbing his temples.
Someone forged her signature and used restricted clearance.
His phone buzzed.
Ida: I need to talk to you. Please.
He typed back immediately.
Meet me tomorrow. Early. We’ll fix this.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Meanwhile, in Kawangware, Ida was staring at the same numbers on her borrowed laptop. Ethan had convinced a friend in IT to help her trace the document’s metadata.
“There,” he said, pointing. “See that code? It means the file came from outside HR—someone used a proxy.”
“Can you find who?” she asked.
“Not yet. But if you get access to the Skeem servers again…”
She nodded slowly. “Then I’ll prove it.”
Back in Runda, Harriet stood by her mirror, her reflection sharp as glass. “He won’t cross me,” she told herself. But the doubt in her voice betrayed her.
She opened a drawer, took out a small flash drive, and stared at it. Monarch Holdings—Q4 Audit. The secret Damon had alluded to. The one that tied them both to years of quiet embezzlement through shell companies.
If he exposed it, she’d lose everything.
So she’d have to strike first.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Morning came heavy with rain. Ida entered Skeem Mall quietly, head down, escorted by security. She was allowed to collect her personal items.
As she passed the executive corridor, Raim appeared, coat over his arm. “Ida.”
She turned, startled.
“I looked through the files,” he said quietly. “I believe you.”
Her eyes filled. “Then why won’t they listen?”
“They will. I just need proof.” He hesitated. “Meet me tonight, after hours. There’s something you should see.”
She nodded.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Upstairs, Damon watched from the mezzanine, a thoughtful smirk tugging at his mouth. He’d warned Harriet once. He wouldn’t warn her again.
He called her. “If you’ve planted something else, remove it. Now.”
“Or what?”
He paused, voice cold. “Or the Monarch audit finds its way to the press.”
There was a long silence.
“You wouldn’t dare,” she said finally.
“Try me,” he replied, and hung up..<br>.<br>.
<br>
By evening, Ida met Raim in his office. Papers lay scattered across the table, highlighted, annotated.
He pointed at the logs. “Look here—the login that authorized the transaction doesn’t match your credentials. Someone with admin access overrode it.”
“Who?”
“Harriet’s team was consulting for us that week,” he said. “She had temporary clearance.”
Ida’s breath caught. “Harriet Maverick?”
He nodded slowly. “We can’t accuse her without proof, but I’ll dig deeper.”
They were still bent over the screen when the door creaked open. Damon stood there, hands in pockets.
“Looks like you two are having fun,” he said. “Just so you know, you’re getting close to something ugly.”
Raim frowned. “What do you mean?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon’s eyes flicked toward the window, his voice dropping. “Let’s just say Harriet’s not new to creative accounting. And if she thinks you’re a threat, she’ll make you disappear—career-wise.”
Ida stared. “You know her?”
He smiled thinly. “Better than you’d guess. And she hates losing.”
Then he was gone, leaving behind only the faint scent of cologne and warning.
Rain tapped the windows as night deepened. Ida stood beside Raim, heart pounding.
“She’s coming for us,” she whispered.
Raim nodded. “Then we need to be ready.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
    Outside, lightning cracked over Nairobi, flashing across the mirrored sign of Skeem Mall.
And somewhere in Runda, Harriet Maverick poured herself another glass of wine, eyes fixed on her phone as a new message arrived:
Access breach detected. User: Ida Mbona.
Her smile returned, slow and dangerous. “Let the games continue.”
Raim then offered to drive her home.
