    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 9</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5: Hillsville</h2>
    <p1>The forest was nothing like what Beldarmore expected. When Xekara led them out of the ruined outskirts of the city and into the deep wilderness, he expected normal trees, maybe some bushes and rocks. But Hillsville was alive in a way that felt ancient. Its trees were towering giants—trunks thick as houses, branches tangled like old bones. Mist curled around the roots, and the air tasted crisp and cold with the altitude.
The deeper they walked, the thicker the silence became. The forest muffled every sound except for the crunch of leaves beneath their boots and the distant rustle of unseen creatures. Mountains rose beyond the treeline, dark shapes against the pale sky.
Antonia looked around with wide eyes. “This place feels… haunted.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon snorted, hands shoved into his pockets. “Oh great, we went from underground horrors to a horror movie forest. Upgrades everywhere.”
Chiesniey glanced back at him sharply. “You want to go back?”
“Not particularly,” Damon said, smirking. “But if a tree starts talking to me, I’m burning it.”
Beldarmore ignored the banter. He was scanning the surroundings the way Xekara had taught him during the walk. Depth, shadows, tracks—these things mattered now. Heida stayed close to him, brushing loose strands of hair behind her ear as she whispered, “It’s so quiet here. Too quiet.”
“It’s safer than the city,” Beldarmore said softly. “That’s enough for now.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Xekara suddenly stopped. The others halted behind her, breaths visible in the cold air. She raised a hand, touching the bark of a massive old tree. The tree seemed to tremble beneath her touch, leaves shifting though there was no wind.
“This is Hillsville,” she said. “The last forest untouched by the rift.”
Heida whispered, “Untouched… for how long?”
Xekara’s violet eyes flicked toward her. “That depends on your strength.”
Beldarmore stepped forward. “So this is where we stay?”
“For now,” Xekara answered. “If you are smart. If you are quiet. And if you are willing to learn.”
Damon raised a brow. “Learn what? How to talk to trees?”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Xekara didn’t even look at him. “How to survive.”
The group exchanged uneasy glances. Beldarmore looked around again and nodded slowly. “We need shelter. A base. Something sturdy enough to hold off whatever might follow.”
Chiesniey stepped beside him. “A clearing with a water source would be ideal.”
Antonia pointed ahead. “There’s light through the trees. Maybe that way?”
“Let’s check it,” Beldarmore said. “Stay close. And quiet.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
As they moved, Heida touched his elbow lightly. “You’re… taking charge again,” she murmured.
He glanced at her. “Someone has to.”
Her cheeks warmed despite the cold. “I… I like it. Makes me feel safer.”
Heida didn’t look away immediately. Neither did he. Something shifted between them—soft, warm, unspoken—but Xekara’s voice broke it.
“Eyes forward, Beldarmore Valgra.”
He turned sharply. Xekara’s expression was unreadable, but something flickered in her gaze before she looked away again.</br>.<br>.<br>.
<br>
                       <br>***************<br>
They found the clearing thirty minutes later. A small waterfall trickled down a stone cliff, forming a shallow pool. Flat ground spread beneath tall pines, and the mountains formed a natural boundary on one side. It was perfect.
Beldarmore exhaled. “This is it.”
Chiesniey nodded. “We can build lean-tos. Reinforce them with stone and wood.”
Heida stepped toward the water, dipping her fingers in. “It’s cold… but clean.”
Damon stretched his arms lazily. “Home sweet creepy forest home.”
“It’s called Hillsville,” Antonia corrected under her breath.
Damon smirked. “Right. Hillsville. Where the trees whisper secrets and the air tastes like regret.”
