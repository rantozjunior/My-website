    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 21</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9: Hunting The Venom <br> (continued)</h2>
    <p1>Damon let out a breath. “One. Just three more and we can go home and pretend this never happened.”
After the second fang, the creature managed to twist violently, almost throwing Damon off.
It snapped at Beldarmore’s arm—Damon jammed his knee into its chest with a grunt.
“Oh no you don’t! We need that venom for our girl! Stay ugly and cooperative!”
Finally, all four fangs were removed, their roots still dripping with venom.
Beldarmore held up the bottle. “Hold the jaw open.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon sighed. “Why do I feel like I’m going to lose a finger today?”
Beldarmore pressed a fang tip to the bottle’s rim and squeezed the venom out, dark and bubbling, into the glass. Each drop steamed faintly.
It was enough.
He sealed the bottle quickly.
Damon stumbled back, panting. “Okay. Done. Let’s go before its cousin shows up.”
Beldarmore nodded, pulling Damon up by the arm. Their eyes met briefly, something grateful and unspoken passing between them.
“You did well,” Beldarmore said quietly.
Damon blinked. “…Did you just compliment me?”
“Don’t get used to it.”
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Damon grinned. “Oh I’m treasuring this forever.”
They moved fast now, slipping through the forest, leaving the dying creature behind. The bottle of venom glowed faintly in Beldarmore’s hand.
They had what they needed.
But something felt wrong.
Too quiet. Too still. Too—
.<br>.<br>.
<br>

Back at Hillsville, night had fallen heavily. Fires burned low. People whispered anxiously as shadows moved along the ridges.
Then the sky lit up with bright floodlights.
Engines roared.
Shouts rose..<br>.<br>.
<br>
Chisniey jolted awake as armored trucks rolled into the village, tires crushing dirt and stone.
Soldiers poured out—over thirty of them—fully armed, helmets shining, rifles raised. Their uniforms bore the emblem of the Eastern Continental Division.
The villagers froze.
“Everyone stay where you are!” a soldier barked. “Hands visible!”
Screaming erupted. Mothers pulled their children close. The elderly raised shaking hands.
Heida and Xekara rushed out of their tents. Sophie, still weak and delirious, stirred as Silas shielded her without hesitation.
From the largest vehicle stepped a tall man in dark green armor, a knife scar running across his cheek. His eyes were sharp and cold—calculated.
General Magliath..<br>.<br>.
<br>
He surveyed the camp, unimpressed.
“This territory is now under military protection,” Magliath announced, voice echoing. “You will follow our orders. You will hand over any weapons you possess. Anyone who disobeys will be detained.”
Heida stepped forward. “We’re survivors. We’ve been protecting this area—”
Magliath raised a hand.
A soldier shoved Heida back with the butt of a rifle.
Xekara snarled, stepping between them. “Don’t touch her.”
Magliath smirked. “Ah. So the children have claws.”
His gaze swept the camp again, landing on Sophie’s weakened body.
“And what do we have here?” he asked.
Silas stood protectively in front of her. “She’s infected. But we’re treating her.”
“Infected?” Magliath’s eyes sharpened. “Then she’s of interest. The military will take custody.”
“No!” Silas shouted.
.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Two soldiers grabbed him instantly, forcing him to the ground.
Heida rushed forward—but a gun pointed at her chest stopped her cold.
Magliath raised an eyebrow. “Any further resistance will be met with lethal force.”
Fear swept through the camp.
Chisniey clenched her fists, realizing there was nothing she could do—not yet.
General Magliath stepped closer to Sophie, examining her with a cold curiosity.
“We’ll need to run… tests.”
Sophie whimpered.
Xekara’s eyes burned with fury.
And across the camp, someone whispered:
“Where is Beldarmore? Where is Damon? They need to come back… now.”
