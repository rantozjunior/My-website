         Ida met his eyes — calm, kind, steady.
“Thank you, sir.”
“Raim,” he corrected softly, before walking away.
When everyone was gone, Ida sat back down in the empty boardroom. Her heart was still racing. She could still hear her voice echoing in her head.
She looked out the glass wall — the city lights twinkled below, the sky deep purple with nightfall.
In that moment, she realized something: this was no ordinary job.
She was in a world of power, secrets, and masks — but she wasn’t afraid anymore.
She smiled faintly to herself and whispered,
“Let’s see how far this goes.”
And somewhere, deep in her gut, Ida Mbona knew — this was the day her story truly began.
 
By the time Ida left the mall, it was past eight. The air outside was cool, filled with the scent of roasted maize and exhaust fumes. The security lights from The Skeem Mall lit up the parking lot like a runway, and for a second, she paused and just looked up at the building.
The glass walls shimmered in the night — tall, proud, powerful — and somewhere inside, decisions were being made that could change lives.
And she’d been part of one..<br>.<br>.
<br>
She wrapped her shawl tighter around her shoulders, the Nairobi wind brushing her cheeks, and walked toward the matatu stage.
“Kawangware! Kawangware moja! Saa hii!”
The tout’s voice pulled her back to reality. She squeezed into the matatu, finding a seat by the window. The bright city lights passed like memories — the sleek cars in Lavington, the towering apartments in Kilimani, the noisy chaos of Junction.
Her phone buzzed — a text from Ephy.
“How was it? Did they treat you nice?”
Ida smiled, her fingers trembling as she typed back:
“It was… incredible. I spoke in a meeting with the bosses. They actually listened.”
Three dots appeared, then Ephy’s reply popped up:
“WHAT?! You?! That’s my sister!! We’re waiting with chai!” 
Ida laughed softly to herself. The tout turned to look at her.
“You look too happy for a Monday,” he said, grinning..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Maybe it’s just a good day,” she replied.
As the matatu roared through the streets, Ida rested her head on the window and let her mind wander — to Raim’s kind eyes, Damon’s teasing grin, Harriet’s sharp stare.
She could still hear Amel Skeem’s voice in her mind — “Put that in writing.”
And she thought of her mother’s words that morning:
“The world can be cruel. Smile, but don’t trust too easily.”
She exhaled, her breath fogging the glass.
“I’ll be careful, Mama,” she whispered..<br>.<br>.
<br>
When the matatu finally stopped at Kawangware, the streets were quieter now — just the sound of distant music and laughter from a nearby shop. She walked the narrow path home, the moonlight guiding her steps.
From a distance, she could already see the soft glow of their small house. Her mother was waiting at the door, Ephy and Ethan peeking through the window like excited children.
“You’re late!” Ephy said, running to hug her. “We almost came looking for you!”
“I had a meeting,” Ida said, smiling tiredly.
“A meeting? Already?” Ethan whistled. “You’ve barely worked a day!”
“It was… something else,” she said with a dreamy sigh.
Nalani took her bag gently..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Come eat, my child. You must be starving.”
Ida sat at the table as her mother served her hot ugali and beef stew. The steam rose in small clouds, mixing with the warmth of home.
For a long while, she didn’t speak. She just smiled, listening to the chatter, the laughter, the sound of life that money could never buy.
Then, softly, she said,
“Mama… I think something big is about to happen.”
Nalani looked at her, eyes wise and calm.
“Then stand tall, my daughter. Don’t let them break your spirit.”
Ida nodded. She didn’t know what tomorrow would bring — but as she sat there, surrounded by love, one thing was certain: the world might be vast, but she was ready for it.
