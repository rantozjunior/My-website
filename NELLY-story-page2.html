    <h1>THE FALLEN WORLD <br> PAGE 2</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: The Day The Sky Broke (Continued)</h2>
    <p1>“She’s… she’s—what?” he asked, voice low.
Chiesniey Marga arrived at that moment, sprinting from a side street. Rifle in hand, vest strapped tight. “Valgra! Here!” Her eyes landed on him and Heida. “Move now, the street isn’t safe!”
Beldarmore turned. “Chiesniey? How—what—”
“No time!” she snapped, grabbing his wrist and dragging them both behind a crumbled building facade. Her expression was all sharp edges and controlled panic. “There’s more coming. Get down!”
The ground shuddered beneath them. Dust and debris filled the air. A low, almost imperceptible hum thrummed in Beldarmore’s mind. He froze.
[System Booting…]
He blinked. The sound wasn’t in the air. It wasn’t from anyone around him. It was inside his own head.
[Host Identified: Beldarmore Valgra]
“What—” he whispered, clutching his temple.

.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Heida stared at him, panic flickering in her eyes. “What did you just say?”
“I didn’t say anything,” he said, his voice tight. “It spoke… in my head.”
Chiesniey’s gaze snapped to him. “What?”
Another roar shook the street. The shadow-creature wasn’t the only one. Massive shapes began emerging from the rift above—wings, claws, forms that defied logic. The air was thick with energy and heat, charged like a storm trapped in a bottle.
Beldarmore swallowed hard. “Well… I guess that explains why I woke up this morning thinking it was just a boring day.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Heida punched his shoulder lightly. “Don’t joke, Beldar!”
He grinned despite the fear. “Humor is my coping mechanism. You should try it sometime.”
Chiesniey’s hand tightened on his arm. “We have to move. Now.”.<br>.<br>.
<br>
Heida’s knees were shaking, and Beldarmore grabbed her hand, steadying her. “We move together,” he said. “All right? Don’t let go.”
They ran, sprinting down the street while the city collapsed around them. Debris fell from buildings. Sparks rained like miniature lightning bolts. Xekara moved ahead of them, silent and deliberate, her eyes scanning the destruction.
“Who is she?” Heida gasped.
“I don’t know,” Beldarmore admitted, keeping his pace steady. “But if we’re lucky, she’s on our side.”
A massive shadow passed overhead. Wings, immense and impossible, blotted out the sun for a moment. Heida screamed. Chiesniey pulled them both down, pressing them flat against the asphalt.
Beldarmore’s mind raced. This is insane. I’m going to die. I’m going to—wait… no, I survive.

.<br>.<br>.
<br>
The words echoed in his mind. Clear. Unyielding. Purposeful. Somehow, amidst the chaos, he felt a flicker of confidence.
Heida shivered beside him. “Survive… okay. We can survive.”
Beldarmore let a small, shaky grin cross his face. “That’s the spirit. But surviving doesn’t mean we can’t fight back. Not yet.”
A shadow descended from the rift. Bigger than anything they had seen, wings stretching wider than the street itself, claws tearing at buildings. The smell of ozone and burning concrete filled the air.
Xekara’s violet eyes met his for a fleeting moment. Something unspoken passed between them: warning, promise, challenge. Beldarmore felt an odd thrill beneath the terror..<br>.<br>.
<br>
“Alright,” he muttered, tightening his fists. “Let’s show them what we’re made of.”
And the world erupted in violet light.
