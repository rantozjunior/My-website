         The morning light spilled through the curtains of Ida’s tiny apartment in Kawangware. She woke to the scent of tea and mandazi, her mother humming softly in the next room. The radio crackled with a news bulletin:
“The Skeem family has announced that their flagship mall will operate twenty-four hours a day, a first in East Africa. The move follows an internal proposal that has impressed investors and local entrepreneurs alike.”
Ida froze, cup in hand. They didn’t say her name—but they didn’t have to. She smiled anyway.
Ephy burst into the room, waving her phone. “Dada! You did that! You’re on Twitter! Everyone’s talking about the Skeem Mall!”
Ethan appeared behind her, smirking. “I told you she’d shake things up.”
Nalani wiped her hands on a kitchen towel, pride softening her face. “You see, my girl? God lifts the humble. You just keep your heart clean.”
Ida hugged her mother, trying not to cry. “I will, Mama. I promise.”

By nine o’clock she was at the office. The marble floors gleamed, the Skeem logo shining like a crown. Employees were whispering about her as she passed. Some smiled. Others looked… cautious.
Raim appeared in the corridor, phone in hand, eyes catching hers. “Miss Mbona,” he said warmly. “You’re early again.”
“Habit,” she replied.
He chuckled. “I like that about you.”
They walked together toward the elevators. He spoke about schedules, about how the transformation plan would need a new HR policy for night shifts. But beneath the professional talk, something quiet pulsed—a rhythm of curiosity, respect, and something softer neither of them named.
As the doors opened, he turned to her. “You make people remember why this place matters,” he said.
She smiled, shy but sure. “I just did my job.”
“Sometimes doing your job changes everything,” he murmured, stepping out.

Across town, in Runda, Harriet Maverick poured herself a glass of white wine and scrolled through her phone. Every news post about Skeem Mall made her jaw tighten. She tossed the phone onto the table, eyes narrowing.
“Elias!” she called.
A man in a grey suit stepped forward. “Yes, Ms. Maverick?”
“Regina Skeem still hosts that charity brunch every Thursday, doesn’t she?”
“Yes.”
Harriet’s lips curved. “Then that’s where I’ll begin.”

The Maverick car rolled up to the Skeem mansion two days later, polished and cold. Regina greeted her at the door, perfect as always—pearls, perfume, posture.
“Harriet! Darling, it’s been ages.”
Harriet smiled sweetly. “Too long, Regina. You look radiant.”
Inside, laughter and crystal clinks filled the hall. Business wives, politicians’ daughters, journalists—all gathered around Regina’s table.
When the chatter softened, Harriet leaned closer. “You must be proud,” she said smoothly. “The new project is all anyone can talk about.”
Regina smiled modestly. “Yes, it’s exciting. My sons have been working so hard.”
“Oh, yes,” Harriet said, stirring her tea. “Especially Raim. Though I heard he’s had… help lately?”
Regina frowned slightly. “Help?”
